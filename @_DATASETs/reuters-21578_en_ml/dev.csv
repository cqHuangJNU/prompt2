  U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
  Yeutter said it was all but certain President Reagan would go
  ahead today and impose curbs on Japanese exports as planned.
      Asked in a television interview what the chance was for
  Reagan to cancel the scheduled 100 pct tariffs on Japanese
  electronic exports, he said ""slim to none.""
      Reagan announced on March 27 he would impose the tariffs to
  retaliate for Japan's failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end
  dumping computer semiconductors in world markets at less than
  cost and to open its home markets to U.S. products.
      Yeutter, on the NBC program ""Today,"" said the United States
  did not want to terminate the agreement and would drop
  the tariffs once Japan began fulfilling the agreement.
      He said Japanese negotiators last week told U.S. officials
  they were honoring the pact, but Yeutter said it would take
  time to monitor any compliance.
      Asked how long that would take, he said ""We want to see a
  pattern of compliance, so in a minimum I would say that would
  take a few weeks.""
      Yeutter said he did not think there would be much consumer
  impact by the tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods
  because the items selected are also readily available from
  other countries and manufacturers.
      He said he did not think Japan would retaliate.
      ""It seems to me it is not in the interests of either country
  to get in an escalating conflict.  The Japanese understand that
  full well,"" Yeutter said.
      He added Japan might challenge the tariffs in the General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), but ""that's more of a
  paper kind of exercise and I don't really expect to see any
  adverse impact on U.S. trade.""
      Yeutter also said he did not see any way the semiconductor
  issue could be resolved before or during a Washington visit
  later this month by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.
      He said he hoped the visit, which is to have trade as a
  major issue, would be productive but ""I don't see any practical
  way to resolve this particular dispute before or during his
  visit.""

  The Soviet oil production target for 1988

      Oil Minister Vasily Dinkov announced the figure on Tuesday
  at the Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal parliament.
      He said a new development strategy, fuller use of oil
  deposits and better housing and pay for oilmen had allowed an

"['dfl', 'dmk', 'interest', 'money-fx']","DUTCH OFFICIAL RATE CUT SEEN STILL LIKELY
  A cut of about half a percentage point
  in Dutch official interest rates is still in prospect, although
  economists said the timing would depend on Bundesbank moves.
      Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank,
  encouraged by a strong guilder/mark relationship and wide
  premiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German,
  might lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first.
      Last month, the Central Bank lowered its special advances
  rate to 5.1 pct from 5.25 pct after the Bundesbank dropped its
  repurchase tender rate to 3.55 pct from 3.8 pct.
      That rate has remained in force, just holding above the
  five pct official secured loans rate which governs commercial
  bank borrowings.
      Given a strong guilder, a further fall in the West German
  repo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff,
  forcing an official Dutch rate cut, analysts said.
      In February, when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate to
  three pct from 3.5 pct, the Central Bank only lowered money
  market rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loans
  rate on lending under its three month credit quota.
      Since then, however, both the Central Bank and Finance
  Ministry have made it clear they favour lower official rates.
      In April, Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said he
  would follow any Bundesbank cut, and last week the Finance
  Ministry expressed satisfaction when it raised 2.25 billion
  guilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 100.10 pct
  for an effective yield of 5.98 pct, the lowest since 1965.
      Technically, analysts said, there has to be a difference
  between the secured loans rate which applies to lending under
  the credit quota, and the tariff on special advances which add
  extra liquidity to the money market.
      Bank economists and dealers said a West German move to
  further lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts would
  result in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate,
  provided the guilder/mark relationship permitted.
      The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around its
  parity value within the European Monetary System of 112.673
  guilders per 100 marks.
      Today, foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10
  guilder cents to 112.705 guilders per 100 at the fix, a level
  that would not permit a change in the interest rate
  differential between West Germany and the Netherlands, dealers
  said.
      An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German and
  Dutch interest rates to ease in the short term. However, he
  said new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation
  expectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates
  in the longer term.
      In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil,
  or even negative, while the latest official economic forecasts
  point to a falling rate of economic growth.
      ""It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement
  negotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,""
  the ABN economist said.
      He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct in
  January, could also contribute to some inflation.
      At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run to
  two pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates,
  currently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in the
  second half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct.
      Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying
  spree on the bond market which would bring yields down,
  probably only temporarily, while money rates could fall below
  five pct.
      Currently, all periods are traded at 5.12 to 5.25 pct in
  the money market.

  The U.S. is drafting options including
  possible trade retaliation against Argentina in a dispute over
  the differential between soybean and product  taxes which
  Buenos Aires levies on exports.
      The drafting of retaliation options follows the failure
  of high-level talks earlier this month to resolve a case filed
  by the U.S. National Soybean Processors Association, U.S.
  officials said. The NSPA charged that Argentina's differential
  export taxes implicitly subsidize soyproduct exports in
  competition with the U.S.
      ""Our only option is some sort of retaliation to restrict
  (Argentine) access to our market,"" said one U.S. source.
     
      The U.S. shelved the NSPA case earlier this year after
  Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said Argentina agreed to
  end the differential.
      But when Argentina announced export taxes for the 1987/88
  year in July, the differential was narrowed only one pct.
      Deputy trade representative Michael Smith met Agriculture
  minister Ernesto Figuerras and Economy minister Juan Sourroille
  on September 29 and the Argentine officials said they could not
  narrow the differential further for 1987/88.
      As a result of the impasse, the U.S. is considering

  and finished leather, the U.S. sources said.

['acq'],"GILLETTE &lt;GS> SEEN OBJECT OF GLOBAL BIDDING WAR
  Ronald Perelman, head of Revlon Group
  Inc &lt;REV>, may be trying to ignite a bidding war for Gillette
  Co that could draw some big international players and in the
  process make a lot of money for himself, Wall Street analysts
  said.
      Several hours before a regularly scheduled board of
  directors meeting, Gillette disclosed that Perelman requested
  consent of its board for an offer of at least 40.50 dlrs per
  share. Perelman needed the consent because he agreed in
  November not to buy stock for 10 years without permission.
      ""I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette and
  more interested in putting Gillette into play because he stands
  to make a ton of money,"" said Andrew Shore, analyst at Shearson
  Lehman Brothers Inc. ""In play"" is a term used on Wall Street to
  describe what happens when a company becomes an unwiling
  takeover target.
      Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlon
  gets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette through
  November of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs per
  share. Gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain of
  three yesterday.
      The agreement would be calculated on the basis of
  Perelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for a
  split. For example, a deal between Gillette and some other
  company at 44 dlrs per share would make Revlon richer by 262
  mln dlrs under the formula. Neither Perelman nor his spokesmen
  returned telephone calls seeking comment.
      ""Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money if
  someone else takes over Gillette,"" said Analyst Deepak Raj of
  Merrill Lynch and Co. ""I'm not saying that is going to happen
  but Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45
  dlrs per share.""
      Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasons
  why Perelman may not be really interested in acquiring
  Gillette. He said Perelman, in the process of taking Revlon
  private after acquiring control of the cosmetics company two
  years ago, probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon's
  operations. ""He's trying to overhaul and improve the image of
  the dearptment store business."" Another reason is that Revlon
  has recently made two other acquisitions.
      Under those circumstances, Shore would not be surprised if
  some company such as Unilever plc &lt;UN.AS> or Procter and Gamble
  Co &lt;PG> decided to take a look at Gillette.
      Shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers for
  Gillette including Sir James Goldsmith, Hanson Trust plc &lt;HAN>,
  RJR Nabisco Inc &lt;RJR>, American Brands Inc &lt;AMB> and Ralston
  Purina Co &lt;RAL>.
      ""Perelman is trying to put the company in play,"" said a
  Wall Street arbitrageur. ""He gets to share in the upside if the
  company is sold."" Another arbitrageur said he expects Gillette
  to resist Perelman's overture. ""I can't see the board
  consenting, what has changed between November and now,"" he
  said.
     
      Another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on.
  ""Perelman never does anything without a fair amount of
  calculation,"" he said. But he added, ""The Gillette board has to
  be careful. They just can't say no or they'll be sued by
  shareholders."" Gillette's board was still meeting at 1700 EDT,
  three and one-half hours after the scheduled starting time.
      According to a copy of Perelman's letter released by
  Gillette, he would be prepared to sign a defnitive merger
  agreement without any financing condition. He said Citibank
  N.A. is his lead lender and First Boston Inc is his financial
  adviser.

  to 25.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87 ended March 31 from 25.23 mln a

      The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand for

      Corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnes
  from 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices.
      The officials said corn imports rose because the world
  surplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reduced
  Chicago prices. The corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in
  1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.
      Sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87
  from 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from

      Soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln and
  the compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.
      The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted from
  increased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said.

['trade'],"US SAYS CANADIAN, ISRAELI PACTS SHOULD SPUR TRADE
  Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter
  said on Monday that the U.S. free trade agreements with Canada
  and Israel should help to pave the way for liberalizing the
  global trading system.
      He said the Canadian and Israeli pacts will not set back
  worldwide reform efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffs
  and Trade (GATT) as some critics feared but help them.
      The GATT talks began a year ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay
  to liberalize the global trading system and to include in it
  trade in agriculture and services such as banking.
      Yeutter made his remarks at a U.S.-Israeli trade meeting
  marking the second year of their bilateral accord. The
  Canadian-U.S. pact, signed by two sides two weeks ago, has yet
  been approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament.
      The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually remove
  tariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods and
  many services.
      Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israeli
  pacts ""other countries have realized that if they want to
  continue to have access to the world's largest market, they had
  better get serious about improving the GATT.""
      The pact with Israel, he said, is gradually increasing
  shipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantially
  increase the gross national products in both countries.
      Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts should
  serve as important precedents for progress in GATT.
      Yeutter said, ""increasing trade is one of the keys to
  enhanced political and economic stability around the globe.""
      He said, ""a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity, not only
  for advanced industrial nations, but also for other countries
  that need to increase trade in order to better their standards
  of living.""
      Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progress
  made in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting to
  protectionism.
      He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congress
  that would force the United States to take retaliatory actions
  against nations with large trade surpluses with the United
  States if the countries practiced unfair trade.
      The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. trade
  deficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is still
  rising.
      Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard to
  resist, but the pending legislation would undermine President
  Reagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade.
      Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto.
      He said, ""President Reagan will veto any bill that contains
  serious flaws, and I believe that veto would be sustained.""

['bop'],"S.KOREA CURRENT A/C SURPLUS SEEN NEAR 10 BLN DLRS
  South Korea's national news agency, Yonhap,
  said this year's current account surplus will near 10 billion
  dlrs amid signs of continuing high world demand for the
  country's cheap cars and electronic goods.
      Bank of Korea officials would neither confirm nor deny the
  Yonhap forecast, saying only that the bank would issue its own
  figures later in the week.
      Yonhap said the January-September surplus in the current
  account, which covers trade in goods and services, totalled
  7.03 billion dlrs.
      This already exceeds the seven billion dlr ceiling for the
  whole of 1987 that the government set in June during talks with
  the International Monetary Fund aimed at averting a too rapid
  revaluation of the won against the dollar.
      The agency said the September surplus was 1.4 billion dlrs,
  up from 468.1 mln in August and 899 mln a year earlier.
      ""Exports in October could be relatively modest due to many
  public holidays, but by the end of this year the surplus will
  be well over nine billion dollars, close to ten,"" Yonhap said.
      The sharp rise in the September surplus came from a
  resumption of export deliveries delayed by strikes the previous
  month.
      More than 3,300 companies, including car manufacturers,
  electronic and electric firms, were hit by labour unrest
  between July and September.
      The South Korean government originally targeted a five
  billion dlr current account surplus this year, but had to raise
  this to seven billion to reflect a startling first-half export
  boom.
      If confirmed, the soaring 1987 current account surplus
  seemed certain to trigger tougher pressure from the United
  States which recorded a 7.4 billion dlr trade deficit with
  Seoul last year, government economists said.
      The U.S. Government, trying to stem protectionist pressure
  at home, has called on South Korea to open more markets to
  American goods and revalue the won faster.
      The won was fixed at 804.90 against the dollar on Monday,
  representing a 7.01 pct gain so far this year.

"['carcass', 'grain', 'livestock', 'trade', 'wheat']","EC AGREES TRADE DEAL WITH ARGENTINA
  The European Community (EC) agreed a
  trade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country
  following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group, EC
  officials said.
      Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentina
  will gain additional trading rights on a series of products
  including meat, fish and cereals by-products.
      But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with
  Canada and Japan and are due to study these again, the
  officials said.
      The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC
  states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased
  quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef.
      Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat,
  saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals
  substitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, the
  officials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit from
  improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular the
  quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500
  tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will
  be increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.
      Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of
  5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced
  levies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.
      The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said
  that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their
  exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. They
  have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement
  on Tariffs and Trade).
      But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve
  Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had
  been affected by the country's EC membership.
      Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the
  fish dispute with Canada.
      Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The EC
  claims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has
  improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied
  with Japanese offers of compensation.
      Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on
  citrus fruits to aid EC exports, to improve tariffs for some
  other farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwear
  and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal.
      EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told

['crude'],"PEMEX OFFICIAL SAYS OPEC OUTPUT CRITICAL TO PRICE
  Crude oil prices could remain around 18
  dlrs a barrel until the end of the year, but OPEC's decision on
  output at its next meeting would be the critical factor, an
  official of Mexico's state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos
  (Pemex), told a group of Japanese businessmen.
      Adrian Lajous, Pemex' executive vice president of
  international trade, said current OPEC output already appeared
  to be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itself
  for the third quarter. ""Production is surging ahead of what was
  originally planned, while demand is growing more slowly than
  envisaged a few months ago,"" he said.
      He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level of
  production in the third quarter would effectively sustain the
  18 dlrs price, and that an increase to what had originally been
  envisaged might soften price levels.
      The 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 in
  Vienna to review its December accord on prices and output.
      ""I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude in
  terms of volume decisions,"" Lajous said.
      A repetition of what happened last year, when OPEC boosted
  output and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs, is
  always there as a possibility, he said.
      ""I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986. I
  expect other oil exporters have learned their lessons and
  discipline will be maintained,"" he said.
      Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long as
  this remains there will be a tendency to instability in oil
  markets, but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during
  1987 if output remains under control.
      He said Saudi King Fahd's remarks last month, that
  increased production was not so important as long as incomes
  would not be affected by the output, were ""very relevant and
  welcome from such a powerful producer.""

  GAF Corp, set on acquiring Borg-Warner
  Corp's valuable plastics business, is believed by analysts to
  be preparing an increased offer for the Chicago-based company.
       Yesterday, Borg-Warner said it agreed to be acquired for
  4.23 billion dlrs by a company to be formed by Merrill Lynch
  Capital Partners. Merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for
  89 pct of Borg-Warner's common stock, and a package of cash and
  securities for the balance.
      Borg-Warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8.
      ""I think it's (the stock price) telling us GAF is coming in
  with another bid,"" said one analyst, who values the company at
  51 or 52 dlrs per share.
      GAF has offered 46 dlrs per share. It holds 19.9 pct of
  Borg-Warner's stock.
      ""You're in a cat and mouse game on how you're going to up
  the price. Obviously, nobody wants to pay more than you have
  to. I think GAF is looking at the company the way we're looking
  at it - that it's worth more,"" Pershing and Co analyst Richard
  Henderson said.
      Henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share.
      GAF has only said it was reviewing the situation. Merrill
  Lynch officials did not return phone calls.
      Analysts have said they believe GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman
  sought Borg-Warner because of its chemicals and plastics
  business. The rigid plastics are used in such things as
  telephones, computer terminals, and appliances.
      ""Where the heck can you buy a world class chemical
  operation these days,"" said Henderson.
      ""He's (Heyman's) got the bucks. He's a heavy hitter, and he
  does not like to get pushed around,"" said Henderson.
      GAF, a roofing and chemicals concern, attempted a takeover
  of the much larger Union Carbide Corp two years ago. While GAF
  did not win the company, it made a substantial gain on its
  investment in Carbide.
      Analysts said GAF already has a large profit built into its
  Borg-Warner holdings. They said even if GAF raises its offer
  and does not succeed, a higher bid from another company would
  give GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock.
      ""It's a win-win situation,"" said one analyst.
      One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would be
  forthcoming shortly.
      ""I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in this
  book,"" he said.
      Borg-Warner's other businesses include automotive parts,
  protective services, which includes Wells Fargo security
  guards, and Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.
      Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who follows
  GAF, said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer, it
  would realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 per
  share.
      ""I think there's a probability he goes up in price,"" said
  Rose.
      Rose said, however, he could not really predict what Heyman
  would do. ""Sam's a low-risk, high-return player.""
      ""Is he trying to build a major industrial chemical
  enterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank,"" Rose
  said.
      Analysts said Borg-Warner's chemical business would add
  earnings momentum to GAF. ""I worked out that paying as much as
  50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time, if
  they sold off most of the non-chemical facilities,"" said John
  Henry of E.F. Hutton.
      Borg-Warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986
  operating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billion
  dlrs. Total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs, and net
  earnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986.
      ""The Borg chemical business is great,"" said Rose, adding
  its only U.S. competitors are Monsanto Co &lt;MCT> and Dow

"['propane', 'ship']","SAUDI TO REMAIN AS KEY LPG SUPPLIER TO JAPAN
  Saudi Arabia is likely to remain the key
  supplier of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to Japan for at least
  the next five years, oil industry sources said.
      Japan, while diversifying its supply sources of propane and
  butane for stable supplies, will continue to bank on Saudi
  Arabian LPG, the sources said.
      They said Saudi's supply capabilities of LPG, an associate
  of crude oil, is guaranteed by its crude output capacity. ""Saudi
  is a reliable supplier in that sense,"" said one trader.
      Japan imports about 50 pct of its LPG from Saudi Arabia.
      No single nation could substitute for Saudi Arabia as an
  LPG supply source to Japan, the sources said.
      ""Saudi Arabia has committed itself to Japanese LPG buyers,
  which has quelled fears that LPG supplies from the Mideast Gulf
  could easily be disrupted in the wake of heightened hostilities
  in that area,"" said another trader.
      Saudi Arabia cut LPG shipments to Japan and elsewhere by 20
  pct in September after a fire put a major gas plant at
  Al-Juaimah out of operation. October shipments were back to
  contractual volumes as Saudi was able to boost exports from
  other ports.
      Attacks on Gulf shipping by Iran and Iraq centered on crude
  rather than products carriers, which has lulled fears of LPG
  supply disruptions, traders said.
      They said an Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz was
  unlikely because it would block Iran's oil shipments.
      Industry sources said Japan's LPG imports will not greatly
  rise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at a
  moderate 2.1 pct a year from 1986 through 1991.
      Japanese term buyers of Saudi LPG are expected to lift
  slightly lower volumes from January 1987, when imports from
  Indonesia are slated to increase, the sources said.
      The customers are unlikely to slash Saudi term purchases in
  large scale when Japan increases annual imports of Indonesian
  LPG to 1.95 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319,000 tonnes in the
  year ended March 1987, the sources said.
      But when demand is sluggish in summer, they will phase down
  term purchases of Saudi LPG and secure lower-priced cargoes on
  the spot market, they said.
      Japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of LPG a year, of which
  5.3 mln tonnes are supplied by Saudi Arabia, 3.3 mln under term
  contracts and two mln through spot purchases. Some 80 pct of
  Japan's LPG imports are from the Middle East.
      Saudi Arabia's state owned oil company Petromin has made
  some concessions on term prices to Japanese customers in the
  recent round of contract renewal talks, and it is likely the
  Japanese will accept the offer, the sources said.
      The Japanese term customers, however, have so far been
  unsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula to
  replace the existing unilateral monthly price notice.
      Japanese buyers pay Saudi Arabia a price notified by
  Petromin each month. Most recently the FOB price was set at 87
  pct of the 17.52 dlrs per barrel government selling price (GSP)
  of Arabian Light.
      Buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftings
  should the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of Arabian
  Light's GSP.
      Petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the
  95 pct for contracts with Japanese customers from next January,
  the trade sources said.
      Petromin also suggested that a seller's option of supplying
  up to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject to
  seller-buyer agreement.
      Under the present contract, Petromin can automatically cut
  supplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume.
      ""If you want to import LPG from Saudi Arabia on a profitable
  basis, you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct,"" said
  an official at a major importer. ""Freight costs are higher for
  cargoes coming from the Gulf than Southeast Asia due to a
  longer haul and war risk insurance payments.""
      Japanese customers will visit Saudi Arabia this month to
  finalise their separate contract talks, now focusing on
  contractual period and volume, which could be very similar to
  current levels, the sources said. ""When we talk business, we
  would seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability of
  high dependence on a single supplier,"" said one.

"['cpi', 'gnp']","S.AFRICA EXPECTED TO UNVEIL EXPANSIONARY BUDGET
  South Africa is expected to unveil
  tomorrow an expansionary budget for the second consecutive year
  in a bid to boost the nation's flagging economic growth rate,
  economic analysts said.
      Faced with competing demands for increased military and
  police spending and the pressing need for more funds for black
  housing and education, Finance Minister Barend Du Plessis is
  expected to raise significantly the government's overall
  expenditure targets when he presents the budget to parliament,
  the analysts said.
      Analysts expect Du Plessis to provide for a rise in state
  spending at least equal to the 16 pct inflation rate for the
  financial year that started on April 1, while ignoring pleas
  from the private sector to stimulate growth by cutting taxes.
      ""Fiscal policy has become gradually more expansionary, but
  simply raising government spending and increasing the budget
  deficit is an inflationary form of stimulation,"" said Rob Lee,
  chief economist at South African Mutual Life Assurance Co.
      South Africa this year is targeting inflation-adjusted
  growth in GDP of three pct against an increase last year of
  less than one pct.
      Growth in GDP over the past decade has averaged about 1.5
  pct, while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled to
  over 30 pct.
      Economists estimate that the government's spending target
  will rise to about 47 billion rand, with revenue budgeted at
  around 40 billion rand. This would leave a budget deficit
  before borrowing of about seven billion rand, or four pct of
  GDP.
      The government, having consistently overshot its own
  spending targets for more than a decade, also faces a
  credibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in the
  budget, analysts said.
      ""The budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure,""
  said Standard Bank Ltd in a budget preview.
      Many analysts in the private sector are now paying less
  attention to the figures presented in the budget and are using
  their own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for the
  money and capital markets.
      South African Mutual's Lee believes government spending
  will again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49
  billion rand this year, leaving a deficit of between 5 and 5.5
  pct of GDP, compared with a three pct limit suggested by the
  IMF.
      ""The IMF limit is obviously going to be abandoned,"" predicted
  one analyst, noting that South Africa has moved steadily away
  from austerity measures recommended by the IMF over the past
  two years.
      The policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in the
  political situation and the onset of an economic crisis
  triggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll over
  loans to the country in September 1985.
      Against a background of Western economic sanctions, falling
  per capita incomes, rising joblessness and high inflation,
  government officials say economic growth is the prime
  objective.
      But private-sector economists caution that the government's
  ability to promote growth by boosting state spending is
  constrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on the
  current account of the country's balance of payments.
      Most of that surplus, this year estimated at around 2.5
  billion dlrs, will be swallowed up by repayments on the
  nation's estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of an
  arrangement reached earlier this year with major international
  creditor banks.
      Within these constraints, economists believe Du Plessis has
  little room to manoeuvre.
      Analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries and
  budgeted spending increases for the state-owned Post Office and
  South African Transport Services suggest that major tax
  concessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely.
      Du Plessis earlier this year announced small concessions
  for taxpayers in a mini-budget before the May 6 whites-only
  election. The poll delayed presentation of the national budget.
      ""This will not be a very exciting budget,"" commented Harry
  Schwarz, spokesman on finance for the liberal Progressive
  Federal Party. ""I do not expect any major tax cuts as all the
  sweets were given out before the election.""
  

"
['acq'],"AMOCO &lt;AN> MAY BUY DOME &lt;DMP>, REPORT SAYS
  Amoco Corp is apparently the successful
  bidder for debt-laden Dome Petroleum Ltd, according to a
  published report.
      The Toronto Globe and Mail, quoting sources close to the
  negotiations, today said Dome broke off talks last night with
  TransCanada PipeLines Ltd, which last week announced a 4.3
  billion Canadian dlr offer for all of Dome's assets.
      No financial details about the Amoco offer were available
  and a Dome spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that Amoco
  had emerged the winner, the newspaper said.
      However, the Dome spokesman indicated that the sale of Dome
  could be finalized and announced this weekend, the Globe and
  Mail said.
      Representatives of Amoco were not immediately available for
  comment.
      Last Sunday, when TransCanada announced its offer, Dome
  said it was also in talks with two other companies, but refused
  to identify them.
      Since then, market speculation has centered on Amoco and
  Exxon Corp's &lt;XON> 70 pct-owned Imperial Oil Ltd subsidiary in
  Canada.
      British Petroleum PLC &lt;BP> and Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD>
  have also been mentioned as possible suitors for Dome.
      In the past two days, Dome management has been pressured by
  the federal government to select the offer from TransCanada,
  the only Canadian company in the bidding.
      Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government appears to want
  to avoid a Dome sale to a foreign company since the government
  gave Dome hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to
  encourage oil and gas exploration in the Arctic, analysts and
  officials have said.
      A purchase by TransCanada would be least likely to run
  afoul of Canadian antitrust laws, however, TransCanada is
  asking for tax concessions from a federal government that is
  trying to hold its deficit below 30 billion Canadian dlrs,
  analysts have said.
      A takeover by Amoco or Imperial would also give a foreign
  oil company a dominant position in Canada's oil industry.
      Imperial Oil is already Canada's largest energy company,
  with 1986 revenues of 7.1 billion Canadian dlrs. Chicago-based
  Amoco had 1986 revenues of 20.23 billion U.S. dlrs. Its Amoco
  Canada Petroleum subsidiary is 100 pct owned by Amoco Corp.

['acq'],"OFFER FOR DOME MAY SHORT-CIRCUIT ITS DEBT TALKS
  A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome
  Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO>
  may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door
  for more takeover bids, oil analysts said.
      Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt
  of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim
  debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer
  substantial payments to creditors will expire.
      Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders
  that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan.
      Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as
  public noteholders in March after several months of delicate
  negotiations.
      TransCanada's proposal ""amounts to a quasi debt
  restructuring,"" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker
  Ltd said from Toronto.
      Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow
  creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet
  to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to
  cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.
      ""The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that
  even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that
  Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,""
  said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in
  Calgary.
      TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome
  was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed
  refinancing packages, Gobert said.
      The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome
  since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders
  to agree to a restructuring, he added.
      ""I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain
  any and all offers (for Dome),"" Gobert said.
      Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that
  TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix
  the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other
  possible buyers from making an offer. ""By drawing attention to
  us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little
  reluctant to come forward,"" he said.
      Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal
  offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a
  confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.
      Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions
  with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other
  unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and
  financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including
  TransCanada's.
      Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price
  for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.
      However, he said not enough financial details are known
  about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of
  TransCanada's proposed offer.

['trade'],"JAPAN IN LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO AVERT TARIFFS
  Senior Japanese officials tomorrow
  open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch
  effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide
  variety of Japanese electronic exports.
      Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japan's Ministry of
  International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of
  meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael
  Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart.
      The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in
  retaliation for Japan's failure to adhere to an agreement to
  end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and
  to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments.
      They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors,
  including television and audio equipment and computers.
      Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little
  likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct
  duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments.
      President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27
  after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986
  U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that
  Japan was not honoring the agreement.
      In making the annoucement, Reagan said ""I am committed to
  the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to
  provide American industry with free and fair trade.""
      Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan's
  semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured
  the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has
  complained about presidential timidity on trade issues.
      Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive
  trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan's
  inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last
  year reached 169.8 billion dlrs.
      About one-third of the deficit was with Japan.
      Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to
  adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it.
      Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals
  but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation.
      He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagan's
  decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense
  of MITI's power to control Japanese traders.
      ""The United States has excessive expectations.,"" he said. To
  stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by
  excess inventories since 1985 will take some time.""
      He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough
  in trying to sell in the Japanese market.

['sugar'],"SMUGGLING BLAMED FOR CLOSURE OF HAITIAN SUGAR FIRM
  A sugar mill which was this
  nation's second largest employer closed its doors yesterday,
  saying it had been run out of business by sugar smuggled from
  Miami and the neighbouring Dominican Republic.
      The closure of the Haitian American Sugar Company (HASCO)
  will idle 3,500 employees and affect as many as 30,000 to
  40,000 small sugar cane planters in regions around the capital,
  the company said.
      ""Because of unprecedented and ever-growing smuggling, HASCO
  regrets ... It cannot continue to accept delivery of sugar cane
  after April 10,"" the mill warned planters earlier this week.
      Since President Jean-Claude Duvalier fled Haiti fourteen
  months ago, widescale smuggling of basic goods such as cooking
  oil, flour, rice, sugar and canned milk has lowered consumer
  prices but bankrupted several local manufacturers, throwing
  hundreds of thousands of Haitians out of work.
      At the HASCO compound, where grim-faced workers lined up to
  receive their last pay, Spokesman Georges D. Rigaud showed a
  warehouse stocked with an estimated 445,000 unsold 100-pound
  (45-kg) bags of sugar.
      ""We are closing because of our huge stock of unsold sugar.
  We have no money left to continue operations,"" Rigaud said.
      He said the company owed 7.6 mln dlrs and had borrowed an
  additional 1.5 mln dlrs in order to pay off workers.
      Rigaud blamed the mill's problems on an order by Duvalier
  two years ago forbidding HASCO from refining sugar.
      He said the government then began importing refined sugar
  at world market prices and reselling it at a huge profit and
  the provisional military-civilian government that replaced
  Duvalier last year continued the policy.
      ""But now with all the smuggling even the state can't compete
  with smuggled Dominican refined sugar,"" Rigaud said.
      HASCO workers earned 4.20 dlrs daily, considerably above
  the usual minimum wage of three dlrs.
      It is generally estimated that every employed Haitian
  supports at least six people. Rigaud said HASCO's closing at a
  minimum would affect 280,000 to 300,000 people.
      Laid-off workers were bitter about the closure. ""We're dead,
  and it's the government that's causing us to die,"" declared
  Lucien Felix, 34, who has five dependents.

['cocoa'],"COCOA EXPORTERS EXPECTED TO LIMIT SALES
  Major cocoa exporters are likely to
  limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world
  prices, sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa Producers
  Alliance (CPA) said.
      The sources said the depressed world market had been one of
  the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the
  11-member CPA which began on Monday.
      They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the
  buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his
  effort to support prices.
      Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed
  operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London
  last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the
  market soon.
      Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoa
  surpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager has
  to buy cocoa under stock rules.
      The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set range
  by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise.
      ""The world's cocoa price at present is just not interesting,""
  commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer.
      Another source said that with much of the 1986/87
  (October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in
  the near term concerns essentially next year's harvest.
      The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in
  Brazil, the world's number two producer, is in private hands.
  This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West
  African producers, where sales are made or authorized by
  commodity marketing boards.
      The CPA includes the world's top three producers, Ivory
  Coast, Brazil and Ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output.
      The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening.

  Iran is preparing lawsuits to file for
  compensation from the U.S. Over the American raid on its Gulf
  oil platforms, Tehran radio quoted Iranian Oil Minister

      The lawsuits would be filed with competent international
  bodies once the exact damage was calculated, he was quoted
  telling a news conference in Tehran. He earlier estimated the
  damage from the U.S. Raid at about 500 mln dlrs.
      The rigs, one of which was heavily shelled by four American
  destroyers on Monday, were still burning almost 24 hours after
  the attack, he said.
      Aqazadeh said the half-billion-dollar damage estimate was
  preliminary. Washington has said the attack was in response to
  a missile strike against the American-flag tanker the Sea Isle
  City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.
      He denied that there was any military hardware on the rigs
  ""except a 23 mm machinegun for air defence."" Reacting to
  Weinberger's remark that Washington considered the case closed,
  Aqazadeh said: ""Iran will also consider the case closed after
  its retaliatory measure."" Iranian officials have said their
  response would not be limited to the Gulf and U.S. Interests
  around the world might come under attack.
      Aqazadeh said the U.S. Military presence in the Gulf
  aggravated the regional crisis and made access to the region's
  oil more difficult, but he did not see the U.S. Attack
  significantly affecting oil prices.
      IRNA said he gave no explicit reply when asked if the
  attack would prompt Iran to block the Hormuz Strait at the

['money-fx'],"NEAR TERM STRENGTH SEEN FOR CURRENCY FUTURES
  Currency futures are likely to move
  higher following the sharp rally today after President Reagan
  announced that Paul Volcker would not accept a third term as
  Federal Reserve Chairman and that Alan Greenspan was nominated
  as his replacement, currency analysts said.
      Contrary to predictions before the Volcker resignation,
  analysts are calling for higher currency futures prices between
  now and the June 8 Venice economic summit.
      In particular, uncertainty about Greenspan's attitude to
  the dollar could undermine sentiment toward the U.S. currency,
  analysts said.
      Greenspan said today that the dollar appeared to be nearing
  a bottom, but the market will bear in mind his remarks in
  Chicago last week that the dollar's recent move upward was a
  technical reaction and that it would trade significantly lower,
  analysts said.
     
      ""Disappointment of European central bankers over the
  appointment will be used as an opportunity to sell the dollar
  lower,"" said Manufacturers Hanover Futures vice president Carol
  Mackoff.
      ""The international community will not like this
  appointment,"" as it suggests the possibility that the U.S.
  budget deficit is too much of a burden on monetary policy and
  that Volcker was unable to get the commitment he sought to
  reduce the deficit, added Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David
  Horner.
       Furthermore, ""that Greenspan was not named two months ago
  suggests that he was not the Administration's first choice --
  and that the status of his appointment was as a bridesmaid,""
  Horner said.
      A declining dollar scenario with higher currency futures
  prior to and throughout the Venice meetings would be mitigated
  only by concrete action as opposed to ""jawboning"" at the G-7
  summit, he said.
      But G-7 finance ministers, judged by recent statements, may
  be at an impasse, analysts said.
      Japan and West Germany today reiterated that neither
  planned further interest rate cuts, despite pressure from the
  U.S. to do so, Mackoff said.
      The U.S., on the other hand, has not cut its budget deficit
  as Japan and West Germany have urged, she said.
      Should G-7 members force a U.S. commitment to cut its
  budget deficit in the next two years, a further decline in the
  dollar could be forestalled, Horner said.
      However, ""the impact from Venice will be nothing if nothing
  changes,"" Horner said.
      Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. analyst Craig Sloane
  said European currencies will likely move to the higher end of
  their 1987 ranges after today's sharp advance.
      For the next two weeks, Sloan calls for September yen
  futures to advance toward the 0.007200 area. He said September
  marks could close in on 0.5700 as an upside target, while Swiss
  francs could climb to a range between 0.6900 and 0.6950.

      Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs
  of medium- and long-term debt on February 20.
      Ecuador, which has foreign debt of roughly eight billion
  dlrs, has not paid any interest to foreign banks since
  February.
      In March Ecuador said it would suspend interest payments
  for the rest of the year because of an earthquake which halted

['trade'],"ISRAEL MINISTER SEES INCREASED EXPORTS TO U.S.
  Israel's exports to the U.S. can and
  must double over the next five years if the mideast nation's
  goal of economic independence is to be achieved, said Gad
  Yaacobi, Israeli minister of Economy and Communication.
      Speaking before an American-Israel Chamber of Commerce
  seminar, Yaacobi said that in 1986 Israeli exports to the U.S.
  were over 2.3 billion dlrs or about one-third of Israel's total
  exports, while imports from the U.S. were around 1.8 billion
  dlrs or roughly one-sixth of the total.
      ""I am convinced that Israel exports to the U.S. can reach
  five billion dlrs in the next five years, if we learn to
  function in the American marketplace and place greater emphasis
  on product quality,"" Yaacobi said.
      While the weakening of the dollar vis-a-vis European
  currencies is a ""bottleneck to increasing exports to the U.S.,""
  Yaacobi said he expects Israel to extend its recent trend
  toward higher U.S. exports.
      In the last ten years, Israeli exports to the U.S. rose
  fivefold, from 417 mln dlrs to 2.3 billion in 1986, while
  imports rose from 888 mln dlrs to 1.8 billion last year.
      Yaacobi said export growth must increase ten to eleven pct
  annually, the rate achieved until the 1973 Yom Kippur War.
       He said that the U.S./Israel Free Trade agreement, passed
  last year and eliminating all duties and other commercial
  restrictions between the two nations through 1994, would
  continue to facilitate the desired export growth.
      Dual agreements included in the FTA allow Israel to act as
  an economic bridge between the U.S. and Europe, enabling U.S.
  firms to export to Europe at lower cost if a certain percentage
  of the exported is produced in Israel, and vice-versa.
      Yaacobi said that tensions among the nations of the middle
  east was one of the main reasons Israel had not yet been able
  to achieve its economic potential.
      Since 1973 the U.S. has given Israel 25 billion dlrs in
  aid, but most of it went to defense expenditures and financing
  military conflicts ""which were imposed on Israel,"" he said.
      Short of achieving Israel's full growth potential, however,
  Yaccobi said it would still be possible to achieve economic
  independence by 1993 or 1994, based on the assumption that
  exports can be doubled from 1986 levels in that time period.

      The three locals represent about 2,600 production and
  maintenance workers, while the remaining two locals cover about
  600 office and technical workers.
      The office and technical workers last negotiated May 21.
  Production at Trail and Kimberley has been shut down since the
  strike began May 9 and Cominco has had to declare force
  majeure, which means the company may be unable to honor
  contracts for products from the smelter and mine.
      Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all of
  which expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.
      The Trail smelter, about 400 miles east of Vancouver,
  produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons of
  lead last year. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley, about 450 miles
  east of Vancouver, produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year,
  most for processing at the Trail smelter.
      The smelter also produced cadmium, bismuth and indium.
      Trail smelter revenue was 356 mln Canadian dlrs in 1986.

['cpi'],"HUNGARY RAISES PRICES IN EFFORT TO CURB DEFICIT
  Hungary has announced sharp price
  increases for a range of food and consumer products as part of
  its efforts to curb a soaring budget deficit.
      The official MTI news agency said the government decided
  consumer price subsidies had to be cut to reduce state
  spending. From today the price of meat will rise by an average
  18 pct and that of beer and spirits by 10 pct, MTI said.
      MTI said consumer goods will also become more expensive,
  with the price of refrigerators rising some five pct. It also
  announced a number of measures to ease hardship, including
  higher pensions and family allowances.
      Statistics indicate the budget deficit tripled in 1986 to
  47 billion forints. Central banker Janos Fekete has said the
  Finance Ministry is trying to cut the 1987 shortfall to between
  30 and 35 billion from a planned 43.8 billion.
      A major tax reform, including the introduction of a
  Western-style valued added tax, is planned for January 1988 in
  an effort to cure problems in state spending.
      But diplomats said the latest announcement shows the
  authorities were forced to act quickly to keep this year's
  deficit under control.
      The measures are also aimed at cooling an overheated
  economy, and could help dampen Hungarians' appetite for
  imported Western goods which consume increasingly expensive
  hard currency, the diplomats said.
      The diplomats also said, however, that they did not expect
  the kind of social unrest that followed sharp price rises in
  other East Bloc states, notably Poland.

['acq'],"DOME &lt;DMP> BENEFITS FROM TAKEOVER SPECULATION
  Shares of Dome Petroleum Ltd posted
  their biggest gain in months in the U.S. and Canada as stock
  markets foresaw a takeover tug-of-war beginning for the
  debt-heavy company.
      Dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock Exchange and
  gained 31 cents to 1.44 Canadian dlrs on the Toronto Stock
  Exchange, where it was the most active stock. It rose as high
  as 1.50 dlrs in Toronto during the day. In recent months, Dome
  has normally moved by only a few cents per day.
      TransCanada PipeLines yesterday announced a 4.3 billion dlr
  Canadian (3.22 billion U.S.) bid for all of Dome's assets, but
  Dome, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, said it is also still
  talking with two other companies, which it refuses to identify.
      Market analysts today said the other two firms are believed
  to be foreign oil companies, noting that TransCanada yesterday
  stressed that its bid is ""a Canadian solution to the financial
  difficulties of Dome Petroleum.""
      ""The talk is about Conoco, which is controlled by DuPont
  &lt;DD>, and Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC>, which sold its Canadian
  interest in 1975 and could be getting back in,"" said Wilf Gobert
  of Peters and Co Ltd.
      David Bryson of Moss Lawson and Co also noted that British
  Petroleum PLC &lt;BP> is mentioned as a possible buyer, despite
  BP's 70 U.S. dlr per share bid two weeks ago for the 45 percent
  of Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD> it does not already own.
      Calgary-based independent analyst James Hamilton has said
  in recent reports that Amoco Corp &lt;AN> has also been in talks
  with Dome.
      Representatives of Atlantic Richfield, British Petroleum,
  Conoco and Amoco were not immediately available for comment.
      Gobert characterized the market action in Dome today as ""awfully
  optimistic,"" given TransCanada's offer to give current Dome
  shareholders stock in a new subsidiary, which it valued at 1.10
  dlrs Canadian per common share.
      Under the offer, current Dome common and preferred
  shareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary, which
  would own and operate all Dome's former assets. TransCanada
  would own 80 pct.
      However, Bryson said the market may be looking at the
  potential for shares in a publicly-traded subsidiary. ""The
  TransCanada offer has quite a bit of upside potential for Dome,""
  he said.
      Gobert said he believes the TransCanada offer is ""at the
  upper end of what I thought somebody would pay for Dome.""
      The TransCanada proposal would pay Dome's creditors 3.87
  billion Canadian dlrs (2.90 billion U.S. dlrs), with another
  one billion Canadian dlrs (750 mln U.S. dlrs) available to
  secured creditors if the Dome subsidiary earns profits above a
  certain level. TransCanada would not detail the profit level.
      Dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billion
  Canadian dlrs (4.5 billion U.S. dlrs) in debt, which it took on
  several years ago when oil prices were high and the company
  wanted to expand.
      ""There has been speculation that Dome's assets are capable
  of supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs, so on that
  basis, the TransCanada offer would be at the upper end of that,""
  Gobert said.
      Dome's debt troubles have often obscured the fact that it
  is a major player in the Canadian oil and gas field. It holds
  reserves of about 176 mln barrels of crude oil and 3.9 billion
  cubic feet of natural gas.
      The company also owns or has an interest in 14.2 mln acres
  of oil and gas exploration land in the province of Alberta, the
  heart of Canada's oil industry.
     Dome owns or has an interest in a total of 36.1 mln acres of
  land across Canada.
     The company also has tax credits of about 2.5 billion dlrs
  Canadian (1.9 billion dlrs U.S.). It reported a 1986 loss of
  2.2 billion dlrs (1.65 billion dlrs U.S.), believed to be the
  largest ever by a Canadian company.

"
['trade'],"TRADE ISSUES STRAINING EC'S PATIENCE WITH JAPAN
  Member states of the European
  Community are starting to run out of patience with Japan which
  they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open
  its market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.
      Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC
  countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the
  willingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese
  government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.
      However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as
  EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.
      Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to
  an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could
  raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S.
  Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17.
      The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations
  entered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed
  to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of
  the U.S.
      The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's
  trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in
  March, up from 1.94 billion in February.
      In 1986, Japanese exports to the EC totalled 30.67 billion
  dlrs, up 4.5 pct from 1985, while EC exports to Japan fell one
  pct to 12.43 billion dlrs.
      In Paris, trade minister Michel Noir said France has
  decided to give Japan a taste of its own medicine.
      Burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozen
  Coquilles St Jacques will be restricted by a strict application
  of French quality standards -- something EC states say often
  happens to their own exports entering Japan.
      Britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of Japanese
  banks and insurance companies to operate in the City of London,
  because the British Cable and Wireless company lost out in
  competition for a Japanese telecommucations contract.
      However, British officials in London have said that the
  government may have gone too far in implying that it would take
  immediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened.
      By contrast, West Germany, with the EC's most successful
  economy, has never threatened Tokyo with sanctions, preferring
  to rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its own
  industries to surmount obstacles to export to Japan.
      The EC Commission itself has switched its tactics in recent
  years, substituting general calls for action by Japan to open
  its market with specific demands for moves in key areas.
      At present, it is, for instance, pressuring Japan to end
  allegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines and
  spirits, to ensure EC companies have a chance to win contracts
  for the building of a new international airport, and to
  simplify certification and safety checks on imported cars.
      EC officials say these tactics yield some benefits, but
  often the Japanese announce modifications of their non-tariff
  barriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount.
      They stress, however, that any action must be taken by the
  EC as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action.
      One of the problems Britain could face if it were to
  withdraw licences for Japanese banks would be that the bankers
  would be welcomed with open arms in Frankfurt or Amsterdam,
  they point out.

"['crude', 'fuel', 'naphtha']","OIL MARKETS SHOW RESPECT FOR NEW OPEC ACCORD
  OPEC has shown itself to be in control
  of the world oil situation with its speed in hammering out a
  pact to limit crude oil output to 16.6 mln barrels per day
  (bpd) for the rest of 1987, oil traders said.
      They said market respect for the cartel has increased since
  it announced Saturday that it would cut fourth quarter output
  to 16.6 mln bpd from the 18.3 mln agreed in December.
      ""There are light oversupplies now, but OPEC ... Has ensured
  there will be no oversupplies in the fourth quarter, and is in
  effect putting pressure on end-users,"" a European crude oil
  trader said.
      In Tokyo, one oil analyst said, ""There's no reason to expect
  a weak market from now on.""
      A Japanese oil trader, also based in Tokyo, said, ""We
  thought OPEC would have difficulty agreeing on fourth quarter
  production so the market will react very bullishly.""
      Traders in Singapore said that while there has been only a
  slight increase so far in spot quotes for Dubai, a benchmark
  crude, they expect price increases over the next few days.
      August Dubai was discussed in cautious early activity at
  around 17.35 dlrs, above Friday's 17.15-20 range, but still
  below the government selling price (GSP) of 17.42.
      Even prices of light Mideast grades, such as Qatar and Abu
  Dhabi crudes, are expected to improve from recent weak
  positions, 15 to 20 cents below their GSP's. Singapore traders
  said sellers might now aim for GSP's at least.
      They said that after initial jumps, they expect prices to
  stabilise and hover around GSPs for the next few months.
      They said the Japanese oil market would be most affected
  and Japanese end-users would need to rebuild stocks for winter
  requirements before October.
      Prices are most likely to rise in the fourth quarter on
  European and U.S. Stockbuilding for winter, they added.
      ""There's no doubt consumption will be higher than production
  by the fourth quarter and stocks are not that high,"" said an
  international trader in Tokyo. Another Tokyo trader was less
  bullish, ""For sure there will be some shortage but it depends on
  how much they (OPEC members) cheat.""
      A Singapore trade source said, ""There is enough cheating and
  leakage in the OPEC sales system to convince traders there is
  no need to worry about shortages.""
      Other traders said the questionable Iraqi production level,
  after Iraq's rejection of its assigned quota, was a bearish
  factor to be considered.
      Traders also said end-users now would buy as much as
  possible on term contracts and buy spot only when the market
  cooled from its initial reaction to the OPEC agreement.
      Spot product prices in Singapore were little changed in
  thin early discussions, with naphtha and middle distillates
  quiet on minimal buying interest.
      Fuel oil products were steady to firm on light demand and
  tight prompt supplies, dealers said.

  Based on field travel in the

      The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about

      It said generally favorable weather from early December
  through February helped compensate for earlier dryness.
      However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 days
  followed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the second
  week of march has raised concern about late planted soybeans
  which are still immature, but the impact may be localized, the
  report said.
      The corn crop is expected to be a record and will create

      Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased by
  more than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields are

  crop has been harvested.

  Dwindling global crude oil reserves and
  the lack of any major new discoveries in recent years will send
  the world into an energy crisis by 1990, the former Atlantic
  Richfield Co chairman Robert O. Anderson said.
      ""It's going to come sooner than anyone thinks,"" Anderson
  told reporters after addressing a Houston business lunch. ""I
  believe we're going to see a change in the world oil markets in
  two to three years because oil is becoming harder to find.""
      Anderson, who retired from Arco last year to form Hondo Oil
  and Gas Co, said world oil consumption is approaching 60 mln
  barrels a day but a current excess capacity cushion of about
  4.5 mln barrels a day will rapidly disappear.
      ""If you looked around the world, you could not scrape up
  one mln barrels a day in shut-in production outside the Middle
  East,"" he said. ""We're soon going to be right back where we
  were in 1973 and 1979.""
      Anderson predicted that world oil prices would end 1987 at
  about 24 dlrs a barrel and continue a gradual climb.
      ""There's no way prices can stay flat because there isn't
  enough supply,"" he said. ""There have been no major oil
  discoveries for the past 15 to 20 years.""
      Alaska's Prudhoe Bay oil reserves, the last major world
  discovery, has already produced about five billion barrels of
  oil or more than half of its estimated reserves, he said.

  The United States said Kuwait was

      State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley, who made the

  with Saudi Arabia concerning expanded security cooperation in
  the Gulf. The two developments occur as the Reagan
  administration continued to come under fire in Congress for its
  plans to bring 11 Kuwaiti tankers under American flags.
      The move is designed to protect the tankers from Iranian
  attacks and ensure freedom of navigation in the strategic
  waterway but has raised fears on Capitol Hill that it will draw
  the United States into the seven-year-old Iran-Iraq War.
      ""The Kuwaitis have discussed the possibility of chartering
  U.S. flag vessels with the Maritime Administration,"" Oakley

['gnp'],"CENTRAL BANK HEAD SAYS PHILIPPINE GROWTH ON TARGET
  The Philippines' first quarter growth
  figures released yesterday indicated the government was likely
  to achieve its 1987 targets, Central Bank governor Jose
  Fernandez said in an interview.
      The National Economic Development Authority (NEDA)
  announced yesterday gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.78 pct
  and gross national product (GNP) 5.53 pct in the first quarter
  from a year earlier.
      ""I don't see anything on the horizon that should cut it
  (growth) short,"" Fernandez said.
       NEDA said GNP had grown 3.56 pct and GDP 3.25 pct in the
  fourth quarter of 1986 from a year earlier. Last year's GNP
  growth, put earlier at 0.13 pct, was revised to 1.51 pct.
      ""Certainly I do not see any shortage in external resources
  and if GNP growth continues at this level I would assume that
  domestic resources on the fiscal side would be generated and
  would not be a stumbling block,"" Fernandez said.
      ""I think even before the figures came out, simply looking at
  key indicators, such as consumption of fuel oil and power,
  showed that the economy was on a different track from last
  year,"" he said.
      Fernandez said consumption tended to be heavier in the
  first and second quarters because of the dry weather, and it
  could drop off in the third quarter.
      He said the most significant sign of recovery lay in the
  manufacturing sector, which grew by 9.64 pct, after declines in
  1985 and a slow turnaround in the second half of 1986.
      ""That is not a seasonal thing, it is secular,"" he said.
      He said the government had met all monetary targets set for
  the first quarter in consultation with the International
  Monetary Fund (IMF). It expected to draw down the fourth
  tranche from its 198 mln SDR stand-by arrangement soon.
      The Philippines has so far drawn three tranches totalling
  58 mln SDRs from the arrangement expiring on April 23, 1988.
  Fernandez said an IMF mission would visit here in July or
  August to review performance in the January-June period.
      He said IMF repayments were projected to total 1.56 billion
  dlrs over the 1987-92 period and drawings only 236 mln dlrs.
  Repayments were inevitable and many countries would find their
  net repayments to the IMF rising in the next few years.
      ""It means that since there will be a net drain on ODA
  (official development assistance) accounts the commercial
  banking system will be requested to hold the line,"" he said.
      It is an internal constraint that exists because the IMF
  debt cannot be rescheduled, Fernandez said.
      The Philippines rescheduled 10.3 billion dlrs of its 28
  billion dlr foreign commercial debt in March.
      Fernandez said Central Bank bills, introduced in March 1984
  to mop up excess liquidity, had peaked at 43.1 billion pesos in
  April 1986. But their unwinding on maturity dates, started in
  October last year, had almost been completed.
      He said auctions of treasury bills, whose outstanding level
  touched 95.44 billion pesos on May 20, were going well.
  ""Treasury bills will remain a basic monetary tool,"" he said.
      Commenting on the country's foreign debt Fernandez said, ""I
  think the Philippine debt stock looms large because our own
  receipts from exports have not taken the same kind of leap
  forward as might have been suitable.""
      The foreign debt is projected by the Central Bank to reach
  29.04 billion dlrs by the end of 1987.
      NEDA said exports totalled 1.2 billion dlrs in the first
  quarter, while imports were 1.4 billion dlrs.
      Fernandez said the government had targeted GNP growth of
  between six and 6.5 pct this year. He cautioned that while
  growth so far was high the targets had not yet been achieved.
      Fernandez said he saw no merit in arguments by some
  economists that the peso, currently pegged at 20.50 to the
  dollar, ought to be devalued to make the country's exports more
  competitive.
      ""By being pegged to the dollar on a basket basis the peso
  has already substantially devalued against all of the country's
  trading partners,"" he said.
      On the proposed Omnibus Investment Code, he said he was
  opposed to a clause which would allow the unrestricted
  repatriation abroad of investments made during the first two
  years after the imposition of the Code.
      The imposition of the Code, scheduled for last January, has
  been delayed by objections from some business groups.
      ""I think any central bank, certainly this one after the
  events of the past two or two and a half years, has to be
  prudent. This is not the time to throw all caution to the winds
  and I'm not about to do that,"" Fernandez said.
      ""It would be ideal if we reach a point where movement of
  capital and earnings can be free,"" he said.
      ""We have had one year of reasonably good results. Certainly
  we continue to have a fairly heavy drain on our external
  availabilities simply by servicing our debts.""

['trade'],"CANADA TRADE RISE SEEN AS START OF RECOVERY
  Canada's trade picture has brightened
  considerably, underscoring economists' predictions the sector
  would post a long awaited recovery this year.
      The federal government reported today that the monthly
  surplus soared to 1.25 billion Canadian dlrs in February,
  double January's 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher than
  February 1986's 189 mln dlr tally.
      ""Hopefully it's the beginning of a trend,"" said Richardson
  Greenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto.
      Economists generally don't expect such large gains over the
  next months, but are looking for an upward trend throughout the
  year.
      ""We thought the trade balance would improve ... over the
  year, and it certainly looks as if this morning's figure is
  indicative of that,"" commented economist James Donegan at the
  Toronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd.
      Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23
  pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billion
  dls in the month.
      ""Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value of
  exports up by 5.9 pct in February,"" the agency said in its
  monthly report.
      Total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85
  billion dlrs in February, while imports slipped to 9.19 billion
  dlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs.
      Economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would end
  up three to five billion dlrs higher than last year's dismal
  10.1 billion dlr total. In 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billion
  dlrs.
      Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched
  off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85
  U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after
  closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.
      The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early
  afternoon trading.
      Economists have been banking on an improved trade
  performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish
  Canadian economy.
      Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched

      The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early
  afternoon trading.
      Economists have been banking on an improved trade
  performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish
  Canadian economy.
      They say the country's consumers, who have been spending at
  a torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlays
  this year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into
  the country.
      Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the United
  States, by far the country's largest market, is expected to be
  strong as a result of a projected rise in American consumer
  spending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency.
      ""We maintain what's going to drive Canada's export
  performance is income growth in the U.S.,"" said Midland's
  Donegan.
      But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economist
  Warren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook and
  said it could be a mistake to read too much into February's
  trade upturn.
      Jestin said, ""Given the fact the U.S. economy is showing
  signs of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicate
  that part of the strength (in Canada's trade figures) is
  probably transitory.""

  of living increases designed to keep pace with inflation, but
  contained no wage increase.       
      The locals' bargaining committees are expected to meet and

       The three locals cover about 2,600 production and

  B.C. lead-zinc mine.
       Output at both sites has been shut down since the
  production and maintenance workers, along with about 600 office

       The two Steelworkers locals representing the office and

      Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all of

  three-year contract and some loosening of the rules on job
  classifications.

      Some Gulf sea captains were reported to be steering well

['crude'],"OPEC DIFFERENTIALS NOT SEEN POSING MAJOR PROBLEMS
  Some OPEC states are unhappy about the
  prices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose
  great problems when the group reviews its six-month-old price
  and output pact in Vienna next week, oil analysts say.
      They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conference
  presidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievances
  about price differentials making some of their crudes
  uncompetitive.
      There has also been speculation by Japanese traders that
  OPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes,
  to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices.
      But most experts agree that a major overhaul of price
  differentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the market
  signals of a dent in OPEC's new unity.
      ""All OPEC members can make a good case for changing
  differentials,"" said one analyst with a major oil company. ""But
  at the end of the day, the attitude is going to be ""leave well
  alone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered.""
      Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also saw
  sales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminished
  customer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases,
  marketing incentives have helped their sales.
      Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by
  means of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside
  better priced grades in a ""package.""
      Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least
  for some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC should
  change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for
  fuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At
  its last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed
  prices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference
  point. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985
  when members offered discounts to attract customers.
      OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8
  mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter
  and 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend
  or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.
      Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not
  mirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr
  target and at most make minimal changes to differentials,
  analysts say.
      The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one
  non-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export
  crudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.
  Extra heavy crudes were among those left out.
      Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil
  exports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say
  only one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at
  official prices, with some of the rest included in processing
  or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.
      Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,
  when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to
  pay the new prices.
     Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude
  -- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --
  was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent.
      In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank below
  its 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived,
  due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has
  risen.
      Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say
  its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.
      But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's Kleinwort
  Grieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push the
  differentials question in Vienna.
      ""It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, which
  holds the presidency, raised the issue,"" he said.

['money-fx'],"IF DOLLAR FOLLOWS WALL STREET JAPANESE WILL DIVEST
  If the dollar goes the way of Wall Street,
  Japanese will finally move out of dollar investments in a
  serious way, Japan investment managers say.
      The Japanese, the dominant foreign investors in U.S. Dollar
  securities, have already sold U.S. Equities.
      But ""if the dollar falls steeply, which did not happen
  yesterday, Japanese investors will definitely try to withdraw
  significant funds from U.S. Shares,"" said Akira Kawakami, deputy
  manager of Nomura Investment Trust and Management Co Ltd's
  international investment department.
      An unstable, lower dollar would also affect Japanese
  investment in U.S. Bonds. ""Japan-U.S. Interest rate
  differentials, which currently look wide enough, mean nothing
  in the absence of dollar stability,"" said Kawakami.
      U.S. Bonds could benefit due to a gloomy economic picture
  following the estimated huge losses in stocks by major U.S.
  Institutional and individual investors, he said. The effect
  should be to rule out any U.S. Interest rate rise.
      But most Japanese investors in U.S. Bonds are still wiating
  to see if the dollar really is stable, he said. The dollar was
  holding firm at above 142 yen on Tuesday morning.
      ""Although Japanese investors sold huge amounts of stocks in
  New York yesterday, most are still looking for chances to
  lighten their U.S. Stock inventories,"" Hiromitsu Sunada, manager
  of Meiji Mutual Life Insurance Co's international investment
  department said.
      Their sales helped send Wall Street stocks down 508 points
  to 1,738, the market's biggest percentage drop since 1914.
      ""Investment in U.S. Stocks and bonds is difficult,
  considering the dangers,"" said Katsuhiko Okiyama, deputy general
  manager and chief adviser of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's fixed
  income securities marketing group.
      Japanese investment at home could start to pick up once
  markets have stopped reacting to Wall Street, the managers
  said. The Tokyo yen bond market is likely to stabilise in one
  or two weeks, which is what investors have been waiting for.
  The bottom for yen bonds should be around a 6.3 pct yield for
  the 5.1 pct 89th bond, they said.
      ""The basic background which has supported the stocks and
  bonds markets has not changed,"" said Norio Okutsu, assistant
  general manager of Nikko Securities' bond department. ""But new
  outflows of funds to the U.S. Will be decreasing.""  However,
  this was already evident three months ago, he said.

  The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6.1
  billion marks at today's tender for a 28-day securities
  repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank
  spokesman said.
      Banks, which bid for a total 12.2 billion marks liquidity,
  will be credited with the funds allocated today and must buy
  back securities pledged on May 6.
      Some 14.9 billion marks will drain from the market today as
  an earlier pact expires, so the Bundesbank is effectively
  withdrawing a net 8.1 billion marks from the market with
  today's allocation.
      A Bundesbank spokesman said in answer to enquiries that the
  withdrawal of funds did not reflect a tightening of credit
  policy, but was to be seen in the context of plentiful
  liquidity in the banking system.
      Banks held an average 59.3 billion marks at the Bundesbank
  over the first six days of the month, well clear of the likely
  April minimum reserve requirement of 51 billion marks.
      The Bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only 12.2
  billion marks, below the outgoing 14.9 billion, banks
  themselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity.
      Dealers said the Bundesbank is keen to prevent too much
  liquidity accruing in the market, as that would blunt the
  effectiveness of the security repurchase agreement, its main
  open-market instrument for steering market interest rates. Two
  further pacts are likely this month over the next two weeks.
      The Bundesbank is currently steering call money between 3.6
  and 3.8 pct, although short-term fluctuations outside that
  range are possible, dealers said.

  Economic growth will remain sluggish in

  forecast.
      Belgium's GDP growth may slow down to 1.5 pct this year and
  next year, bringing a rise in the number of jobless, the OECD
  said in its semi-annual survey. Belgian inflation could
  stabilise at 1.5 to 2.0 pct, while the current account surplus
  will probably remain large at about three pct of GDP.
      While the Belgian government has made progress in trimming
  its borrowing requirement, ""it will probably be insufficient to
  check the self-sustaining nature of the deficit,"" the OECD said.
      In the Netherlands real GDP growth will also slip to 1.5
  pct this year and one pct in 1988, with Dutch exports becoming
  less competitive and imports rising. ""Employment is forecast to
  decelerate as well, reflecting more sluggish growth in the
  private sector and budgetary cuts,"" the report said.
      Dutch consumer prices are set to fall by 0.5 pct in 1987
  and stay stable in 1988, partly as a result of declining
  domestic gas prices.
      Luxembourg's economy, by contrast, will see slightly faster

  U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
  Lyng said he is pleased the European Community plans to offer a
  global farm reform plan at GATT later this month, although the
  United States opposes key parts of the proposal.
      ""We're pleased that they have moved in tabling a proposal.
  It will help us in getting the negotiations underway,"" Lyng
  told Reuters in an interview Tuesday.
      Lyng's comment came after EC ministers in Luxembourg
  endorsed a farm reform package drafted by the EC Commission.
  The EC plan will be presented at the next meeting of Uruguay
  round agriculture negotiators in Geneva on October 26.
      Lyng said the United States would oppose parts of the plan
  seeking a market sharing agreement for grains, and proposing
  curbs on U.S. soybean and cereal substitute exports to Europe.
      The U.S. in July proposed to GATT the elimination of all
  farm subsidies affecting trade within ten years, and has
  pressed the EC to make a counter-offer with the aim of reaching
  a global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988.
      However, the EC and some U.S. domestic groups have said the
  Reagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies is
  unrealistic.
      Asked about such criticism, Lyng said ""The alternative to
  doing that is to say that we preserve them and maintain them. I
  think that is the unrealistic position.""
      ""I would suggest that they (EC) listen to what we are
  trying to say.""
      Lyng also rejected suggestions the U.S. and EC agree a
  freeze in export subsidies to get the GATT negotiations 
  started.
      ""All that some countries would like to have would be a
  wheat agreement where we would stop export subsidies on wheat.
  That doesn't do a thing for us,"" Lyng said.
      The United States wants an end to subsidies in a range of
  agricultural products from dairy products to vegetable oils, he
  said.
      At the GATT negotiators meeting next week Canada is
  expected to offer a proposal as well as the EC.
      The United States will be represented at the meeting by

      The termination is effective January 1, 1988, the Treasury

      The Treasury decided to end the treaty after negotiations

      Terminating the tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles

  spokesman said.
      He said the Treasury did not expect the action to have an
  adverse effect on U.S. issuers of the bonds because the general

  Taiwan announced plans for another round

  talks with Washington which officials described as a move to
  help balance trade with the United States.
      Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry's
  Customs Administration Department, told reporters the list of
  products included 60 items asked by Washington.
      ""The move is part of our government efforts to encourage
  imports from our trading partners, particularly from the United
  States,"" he said.
      He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinet
  that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles,
  apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut
  by between five and 50 pct.
      The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday
  and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting
  on April 20, he added.
      Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700
  foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce its
  growing trade surplus with the United States, the island's
  largest trading partner.
      Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and
  pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade
  deficit with Taipei.
      Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6
  billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. It
  widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78
  billion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show.
      Today's announcement came before a departure later today of
  a 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series of
  trade talks with U.S. Officials.
      The delegation's leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters last
  night he was leaving with ""a heavy heart,"" meaning that he would
  face tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionist
  sentiments in the U.S. Congress. Taiwan's 1986 trade surplus
  with Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada.
      Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S.
  Calls for Taiwan to open its market to American products,
  purchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment,
  import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property.

      The Sassan and Rostam fields have been targets for Iraqi
  air strikes in the past, but Baghdad had not reported any
  southern Gulf missions prior to news of the latest attack.
      Shipping and military sources in the region have said Iran
  used its southern Gulf rigs as bases to launch helicopter and
  later speedboat attacks on neutral ships in the waterway.
      U.S. Officials had been meeting on a response since Friday
  when an attack on a Kuwaiti port severely damaged a
  U.S.-flagged ship. President Reagan said on Sunday he had
  already made a decision on the U.S. Response to Friday's Iran

  A South African trade union is in

      The 30,000-member mainly black Chemical Workers Industrial

  homeland, where South African unions are not recognised, could
  lead to job losses and affect wages.
      A mass dismissal last year at the Impala Platinum Holdings

  no final decision had been taken on strike action.
      The refinery processes all platinum metals of Rustenburg

  Figures for first quarter 1987 West
  German GNP will be published on June 11 after they were
  provisionally scheduled for June 4, an official at the Federal
  Statistics Office said.
      The official said there had been a delay in gathering
  information for the data, which are expected to show that the
  West German economy contracted in the period.
      A spokesman for the Economics Ministry in Bonn said there
  was no political motivation behind publishing the figures on
  June 11, the day after the Venice economic summit ends.
      ""There is no political motivation. It is a purely technical
  matter,"" he added.
      The West German government is expected to come under
  pressure in Venice from both the U.S. And its European partners
  to stimulate domestic demand as a way of reducing international
  trade imbalances and contributing to world economic growth.
      However, government officials have ruled out any further
  tax reduction packages to supplement a major program of
  stimulatory fiscal measures already underway.
      Helmut Schlesinger, vice-president of the West German
  central bank, the Bundesbank, said in Tokyo today that GNP, the
  widest measure of a country's economic activity, fell in real
  terms by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first
  quarter compared with the fourth 1986 period.
       The government has confirmed that growth was negative in
  the first 1987 quarter. But year-on-year growth is expected to
  be about two pct.
      Schlesinger today repeated the Bundesbank's reluctance to
  cut its official interest rates further. Its key discount rate,
  at three pct, is just above historical lows.
      West German officials are likely to emphasise at the Venice
  summit that domestic demand, which draws in goods from abroad,
  is already outstripping export performance, which has suffered
  from an 80 pct rise of the mark against the dollar in just over
  two years.
      The government has pointed out that depressed exports are
  the main reason for the current weakness in the economy, but
  says that later in the year stronger domestic demand will
  compensate for this setback.
      It expects GNP growth for the whole of 1987 of just under
  two pct, after a 2.4 pct rise in 1986.

['gnp'],"GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN RAISES NEW DEBT FEARS
  The global economy is expected to
  weaken this year, adding new worries to an already serious
  poverty outlook, economic analysts said.
      For finance ministers and central bankers attending this
  week's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund
  and World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add an
  additional concern.
      The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pct
  this year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985.
      In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, a
  measure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to
  2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said.
      For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product,
  another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0
  pct from 3.5 pct last year.
      The new figures are considered a major disappointment to
  the poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in the
  industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil
  prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope
  with growing mounds of debt.
      IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believed
  the industrial country economies would move up to an annual
  growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.
      Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some
  time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into
  an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.
      Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier
  states for markets for their products as well as financial
  assistance, economic weakness in the developed nations' 
  economies poses fundamental worries.
      Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, have
  only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange,
  including the key one of exports.
      The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion,
  has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but it
  too is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only
  2.3 pct, according to the IMF.
      For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, the
  United States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to
  ignite their economies but with little apparent success.
      The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and
  the curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. trade
  deficit.
      Reagan administration officials have been saying that the
  impact is now beginning to show up, although it has been much
  slower than expected.
      The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that ""it has
  to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to
  work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years
  to get a resonably complete effect.""
      The report added, however, ""the adjustments may take even
  more time on this occasion.""

['gnp'],"WEST GERMAN INSTITUTES CALL FOR EARLY TAX CUTS
  The five leading West German economic
  research institutes said the government should do more to
  stimulate economic growth and called for early introduction of
  tax cuts planned for 1990.
      In their joint spring report the institutes were divided
  about 1987 growth forecasts, with three predicting two pct
  expansion and the other two only one pct growth. Gross national
  product grew 2.4 pct last year.
      But the report said all the institutes believed that ""more
  must be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additional
  jobs can be created.""
      The institutes said any step which improved basic economic
  conditions should be taken as quickly as possible. ""From this
  point of view, the tax reform planned for 1990 should be
  brought forward.""
      The government plans gross tax reductions of 44 billion
  marks as part of the major tax reform. The net tax relief from
  the tax reform will amount to 25 billion marks.
      However, the institutes criticised the government, not only
  for the timing of the reform, but also because the question of
  its financing had been left open.
      The government has not specified how the remaining 19
  billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for,
  though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies.
      The institutes said this lack of clarity from Bonn had
  caused uncertainty among companies and households as to what
  exactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged a
  quick decision from the government.
      They also said the government should reduce tax
  preferences, which would simplify the fiscal system, urged a
  restriction of state spending and called for no increase in
  value-added tax.
      The institutes also criticised Bonn for increasing
  subsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged.
      They referred specifically to a doubling of special
  writedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in a
  package of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described this
  as an increase in subsidies.
      The institutes said total subsidies, including tax
  preferences, had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risen
  further since then. Given the scope of these subsidies, it
  should be possible ""despite ... Major political difficulties"" to
  finance the tax reform by cutting state handouts.
      The institutes said that if the government raised value
  added tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of the
  positive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost.
      The report also noted that the government was progressing
  only slowly with its plans to privatise state companies and
  said more deregulation was needed. The government had to aim
  for more competition, it said.

['crude'],"TEXACO FILING ADDS UNCERTAINTY IN OIL MARKET
  U.S. oil traders said Texaco Inc's
  filing for protection under the Chapter 11 bankruptcy code is
  adding uncertainty to an already skittish oil market, but
  opinions are divided on the impact to the market.
      ""The filing is holding up wet barrel trading today,"" said
  one trader. ""Everyone is talking about it, assessing their
  company's situations in relation to Texaco,"" he added.
       Some traders said companies that deal with Texaco are
  concerned about whether they will receive payment or supplies
  under the bankruptcy filing.
      However, others were less worried. ""The first paid will be
  the trading community and those connected with Texaco in the
  shipping industry,"" one New York trader said.
      ""If Texaco doesn't get crude supplies it can't run its
  refineries, so its other assets would not be worth anything,""
  he added.
      Texaco filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
  bankruptcy code yesterday after failing to reach a settlement
  with Pennzoil on an 11 billion dlrs court award for illegally
  interferring with Pennzoil's proposed purchase of Getty Oil Co.
      However, others were less worried. ""The first paid will be

  bankruptcy code yesterday after failing to reach a settlement
  with Pennzoil on an 11 billion dlrs court award for illegally
  interferring with Pennzoil's proposed purchase of Getty Oil Co.
      ""There is some reluctance to trade with Texaco but no great
  change,"" said another trader, adding that traders are tending
  toward prudence in their dealings with the company.
      Traders are assessing whether to require cash prepayment or
  letters of credit, or to continue to trade as usual with Texaco
  on an open line basis, he said.
      Another trader, however, described today's activity as
  business as usual, adding that traders feel more secure because
  no liens can be put on Texaco's assets while it is in
  bankruptcy.
      Traders said there was no apparent effect of the Texaco
  filing on crude futures trading although they said the exchange
  might lower Texaco's position limit and require higher margins
  for Texaco's trades.
      New York Mercantile Exchange President Rosemary McFadden
  declined to comment on Texaco's futures trading, saying that is
  is proprietary information. McFadden did say, however, that as
  a matter of procedure, it is possible the exchange can lower
  allowable position limits or increase margin requirements for
  companies that are in financial trouble.

"['cpi', 'income', 'retail', 'trade', 'wpi']","YUGOSLAV ECONOMY WORSENED IN 1986, BANK DATA SHOWS
  National Bank economic data for 1986
  shows that Yugoslavia's trade deficit grew, the inflation rate
  rose, wages were sharply higher, the money supply expanded and
  the value of the dinar fell.
      The trade deficit for 1986 was 2.012 billion dlrs, 25.7 pct
  higher than in 1985. The trend continued in the first three
  months of this year as exports dropped by 17.8 pct, in hard
  currency terms, to 2.124 billion dlrs.
      Yugoslavia this year started quoting trade figures in
  dinars based on current exchange rates, instead of dollars
  based on a fixed exchange rate of 264.53 dinars per dollar.
      Yugoslavia's balance of payments surplus with the
  convertible currency area fell to 245 mln dlrs in 1986 from 344
  mln in 1985. The National Bank said the drop was due to a
  deterioration in trade. Exports to the convertible currency
  area rose 11.6 pct from 1985, while imports rose 17.8 pct.
      Retail prices rose an average of 88.1 pct in 1986 while
  industrial producer prices rose by 70.6 pct, the bank's data
  showed. The cost of living rose by 89.1 pct.
      Personal incomes rose by 109 pct in 1986.
      Prime Minister Branko Mikulic warned in February that wages
  were too high given the level of productivity.
      Mikulic introduced a law cutting wages to the level of the
  last quarter of 1986 and tying future rises to productivity.
      Bank statistics show the overall 1986 rise in M-1 money
  supply was 109.1 pct with a year-end position of 3,895.9
  billion dinars. Yugoslavs have 9.8 billion dlrs worth of
  foreign currency savings in the country and 20 billion dlrs
  abroad, mostly owned by workers employed in western Europe.
      The dinar fell by 73.1 pct against a basket of hard
  currencies in 1986. The highest depreciation was against the
  Swiss franc, 85.3 pct, and the lowest against the U.S. Dollar,
  46.2 pct.

  European coffee traders and roasters
  may propose a new formula for calculating International Coffee
  Organization (ICO) coffee quotas at the end of their meeting
  here this week, traders and officials told Reuters.
      Although traders were unwilling to reveal details of the
  possible new formula, they said it would give Brazil, the
  world's biggest coffee producer, unchanged ICO quotas for the
  next two years and could be a basis for renegotiation.
      ""The main sticking point on quotas has been Brazil's
  attitude, and this compromise could be a solution, "" one said.
      However, the European coffee trade federation meeting,
  which began here today and is to continue to the end of the
  week, has revealed gaps in the European position on
  re-introducing quotas.
      Traders said that, as a whole, the trade side was against
  re-introduction of ICO quotas, while roasters were generally in
  favour with the single proviso that there had to be some
  formula basis for re-allocating quota shares among producing
  countries.
      The roasters said the positions were generally fairly
  close, and problems with some Government officials.
      Germany and Italy were cited as the extremes of polarized
  Government attitudes, with most other countries on the fence.
      Sources said Germany was the most extreme against quota
  re-introduction, while the Italians were most in favour.
      ""Nevertheless, we expect to find enough common ground by the
  end of the week to at least present a common European Community
  (EC) view at the next meeting of consumer members of the
  International Coffee Agreement (ICA) in July,"" one trader said.
      ""We hope we can present the compromise proposal and that not
  only the consumer side, but the producer side will accept it,""
  one official said.
      ""We have learned that we can live without the quotas that
  were suspended in February last year, but would prefer the
  stability they can bring to the market as long as we do not
  simply return to the old and outdated status quo as far as
  quota allocation is concerned,"" he added.
      Overall, however, trader and roaster opinion on the
  likelihood of a successful re-negotiation was mildly
  pessimistic, varying between a 50-50 chance and 60-40 against.
      ""Our main difficulty will be to persuade the U.S. On the
  consumer side and Brazil on the producer side to agree to quota
  re-introduction, "" he said.
      ""The U.S. Position has, if anything, hardened, while the new
  Brazilian Coffee Institute president has adopted the least
  negotiable position of any of his predecessors,"" one trader
  said.
      ""However, with many producers starting to swing in favour of
  the consumer position that quotas have to be re-allocated under
  a new formula, Brazil is becoming increasingly isolated, which
  gives at least some hope of a compromise at the ICO quota
  meeting in September,"" the official said.

"['interest', 'reserves']","U.K. RESERVES LIFT HOPES OF FURTHER BASE RATE CUT
  The record 4.9 billion dlrs rise in U.K.
  Reserves in May to a total 34.7 billion has lifted hopes for a
  further cut in bank base lending rates after the June 11
  general election, market analysts said.
      Sterling would have risen on the much better than expected
  number but for market nerves about the poll outcome, they said.
      But the weight of foreign currency and gold reserves now
  available to the authorities to support the pound should curb
  any market tendency to panic if U.K. Opinion polls show the
  ruling Conservative Party's lead slipping, they added.
      ""We have been intervening to a very much greater extent than
  we have done hitherto,"" Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
  said at a news conference today, commenting on the news of the
  record reserves rise.
      He put the U.K. Intervention in the context of the Louvre
  accord between leading industrial nations to stabilise the
  dollar, partly through direct intervention on foreign
  exchanges. ""We have been playing a very full part ourselves,"" he
  said.
      But market analysts see the recent upward pressure on
  sterling, and consequent need for official sales to damp down
  its rise, more in the light of local factors.
      Steven Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell Securities,
  said that corporate money has been flowing back into Britain
  amid hopes of another Conservative government, after fears last
  autumn of a Labour election victory sent it flooding out.
      U.K. Portfolio investment is also returning, while foreign
  buyers see U.K. Growth propects and high bond yields as
  attractive. They will be strong buyers of U.K. Assets, notably
  equities, once the election is out of the way, Bell said.
      Analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lower
  interest rates, as the government is expected to try to reverse
  the loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound.
      Today, however, the pound hardly moved on the reserves
  news, dipping on its trade-weighted index against a basket of
  currencies from 73.1 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 GMT to 73.0
  pct at 1100 GMT, half an hour after the figures were released.
      ""The market doesn't want to do anything because of the
  election,"" commented an economist at a big U.S. Investment bank.
      Several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts of
  a rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs had
  overestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely to
  have been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on the
  forward market.
      The market also seemed to have overestimated the amount of
  sterling the Bank of England bought at the end of May to smooth
  the pound's sudden downturn, while some of the intervention
  reported in May probably occurred in April, they said.
      The key three months interbank money market rates eased
  about 1/8 point, reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrend
  in U.K. Interest rates will be revived following the reserves
  news, analysts said.
      Government bond prices initially firmed, but the market was
  muted as traders worried about the funding implications of
  another huge rise in reserves, they added.
      Morgan Grenfell's Bell forecast a half point base rate cut
  from the current nine pct level soon after the election, so
  long as poll projections of another Conservative victory prove
  accurate, with another half point later.
      Justin Silverton, equity economist at Credit Suisse
  Buckmaster and Moore, said a full point reduction might be
  possible. ""Sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts in
  future, rather than this active intervention,"" he predicted.
      Kevin Boakes of Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged cautioned
  against over-optimistic forecasts, but agreed a half point cut
  looked likely.
      A cut before the election has been virtually ruled out.
      ""The Bank (of England) is both worried about the political
  problem of cutting rates during an election campaign ... And
  has signalled some worry about broad money (growth),"" said Robin
  Marshall, chief U.K. Economist at Chase Manhattan Securities.
      He said the 10 billion dlrs increase in total reserves in
  the past seven months may foreshadow full U.K. Entry into the
  European Monetary System.
      But Bell said the authorities would like to see another 10
  or 15 billion dlrs in the reserves before joining, if they did
  so. But, unlike many analysts, he doubted the U.K. Will go in.

"['dlr', 'yen']","U.S. SAID TO VIEW G-7 MEETING AS MAJOR SUCCESS
  The United States, which has long
  sought Japanese action to stimulate its economy, appears to be
  satisfied Tokyo's latest package is a major development and
  allows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreement
  to stabilize currencies.
      Monetary sources said they believed that U.S. Treasury
  Secretary James Baker considered Tokyo's package, announced
  yesterday, to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy.
      But yesterday's statement by seven leading industrial
  powers endorses the yen's rise from around 153 to the dollar,
  the level at the February 22 Paris Accord, to about 145 today.
      And the initial reaction of currency markets in the Far
  East demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced that
  currencies yet reflect economic fundamentals, even though the
  countries appear to do so. The yen sank below 145 at one point
  despite intervention by the Bank of Japan.
      Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's Finance Minister, said the
  movement since Paris was consistent with currency trading
  ranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks.
      ""I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past
  several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the
  discussions in Paris,"" Miyazawa said yesterday.
      The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs was
  announced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of
  Miyazawa's departure for Washington, to attend yesterday's
  meetings of leading industrial nations.
      In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action
  ""extraordinary and urgent"", the meeting reaffirmed the Paris
  Accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges
  broadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.
      The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, West
  Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- therefore
  repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to
  foster exchange rate stability.
      The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central
  bank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the
  dollar's fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale of
  intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent
  years. Monetary sources also said they understood that
  Secretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely
  successful in the light of the Japanese announcement.
      They also said there was a growing feeling among the
  finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over
  medium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term
  differences in past meetings.
      West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything like
  the yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face of
  yesterday's statement to have won acceptance from other
  countries that its exchange rate is acceptable.
      Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that
  major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance
  between West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America's
  trade deficit have already taken place.
      No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cut
  the budget deficit even though it is implied in the
  reafffirmation of Paris.
      European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are
  essential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall that
  reached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.
      A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this
  week by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A further
  sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would ""clearly pose
  substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could
  undermine confidence in future financial stability,"" he said.
      Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the
  politically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.
      Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germany
  welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own
  currency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.
      Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak
  dollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States, the
  Japanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.
      The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on making
  their policy coordination more binding and one, Canadian
  Finance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.
      Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit
  to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.
      The United States and France, backed by the International
  Monetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or ""norms"" for a
  limited number of economic objectives such as growth,
  inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and current
  account balances.
      Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in
  consultations between the countries on whether corrective
  action should be required.
      But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives
  has Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because it
  implies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.
      The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully
  sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit
  currency fluctuations just before the February meeting.
      The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges
  of the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the
  relatively free currency markets of recent years.

  would give Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, an
  unchanged quota for the remaining two years of the current
  coffee agreement, van Horick said.
      If accepted by the consumer and producer members of the
  ICO, the formula could also be a basis for negotiating a new
  agreement, van Horick said.
      Coffee quotas were suspended in February last year when
  prices shot up on fears of a drought-induced crop disaster in
  Brazil.
      Although prices are now considerably lower, consumers and
  producers have been unable to agree on re-introduction.
      ""Brazil has been the most strongly against any change in the
  formula because it feared a lower quota. But our proposal
  leaves it very little to object to,"" van Horick said.
      ""The existing quota system is far too rigid and does not
  reflect supply and demand reality,"" he said. ""Our formula
  builds flexibility into the system and will benefit almost
  everyone.""
      Although full implications of the new formula have still to
  be worked out, initial estimates suggest countries such as
  Colombia, Kenya, Indonesia and Costa Rica would get slightly
  higher quotas, while others such as the Ivory Coast, El
  Salvador and Nicaragua would lose quota share, van Horick said.
      Because the proposal provides that future quota
  distribution must reflect current demand and actual supply, it
  should also prevent under-shipment of quota as countries doing
  so would automatically prejudice their following year's quota.
      ""If the ICO consumers accept our proposal it stands at least
  a fair chance of being accepted by the producers at the
  September meeting, most of whom are generally in favour of a
  new quota formula, "" van Horick said.
      At the same time much will depend on Brazil's attitude.
      ""Brazil is increasingly isolated on the producer side. If
  there is no frost damage to its coffee crop over the next two
  months and most other producers favour our proposal, we might
  just get an agreement,"" van Horick added.

  U.S. Exports of edible
  groundnuts could fall to 185,000 tonnes in the year to
  September 1987 from 248,000 in the same 1986 period, trading
  company Tracomin SA said.
      It revised its December 1986 forecast that exports would
  total 205,000 tonnes, citing low demand, the loss of U.S.
  Market share in the two main importing countries, Britain and
  the Netherlands, and the sale of nuts intended for export at a
  premium in the U.S. Domestic market.
      Tracomin estimated export availability from the 1986 crop
  at 215,000 tonnes compared with 264,000 the previous year.
      Tracomin said it expects a good 1987 U.S. Groundnut crop
  and forecast a resurgence in U.S. Exports next year.
      ""Barring any market manipulations, a good U.S. Harvest in
  1987 could lead to attractive prices, active trading and the
  reappearance of the U.S.A as the world's leading producer of
  peanuts,"" it said.
      Overall exports from China, the leading exporter last year,
  will remain at exceptionally high levels this year despite

  Member states of the European

  they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open
  its market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.
      Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC
  countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the
  willingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese
  government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.
      However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as
  EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.
     Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to
  an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could
  raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S.
  Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17.
      The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations
  entered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed
  to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of
  the U.S.
      The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's

  A proposal to require imported
  tropical oils to be labeled as saturated fats suffered a narrow
  and possibly debilitating defeat in the U.S. Senate.
      The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a
  10-8 vote, virtually snuffing out U.S. soybean producers' hopes
  the plan would be adopted this year.
      A similar proposal has made no headway in the House.
      Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered the proposal as an
  amendment to a farm spending reduction package.
      ""I don't see this as a trade issue. I see it as giving
  American consumers the information they need,"" he said.
      Proponents of the measure, including the American Soybean
  Association, have claimed palm, palm kernel and coconut oils
  are high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease.
      The U.S. soybean industry believes labels indicating
  tropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourage
  consumption of the oils, imported primarily from Malaysia,
  Indonesia and the Philippines.
      But Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) read a letter from U.S.
  Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, who said the proposal
  ""blatantly discriminates"" against imports, would be impossible to
  defend under international trade law and would harm relations
  with the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.
      Yeutter's letter also said Americans derive most of their
  saturated fats from meat and dairy products and relatively
  little from tropical oils.
      The committee voted largely along party lines, with three
  Democrats joining seven Republicans to oppose the measure.

      The advisory body said in its report that the yen would

      An EPA official told Reuters the dollar could fall to

      The dollar's fall without structural adjustments would cut

  would slow real GNP growth to an average of two pct annually
  during the seven-year period to 1993.
      If the two nations restructured their economies, the dollar
  would remain stable in real terms, while reducing Japan's

  The European Community (EC) accused the

  through practices including a tax on imported gasoline and a
  customs user fee.
      EC ambassador Tran Van-Thinh made the formal charge to the
  surveillance body of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
  (GATT), GATT spokesman David Woods told reporters.
      Woods also said the EC was joined by the United States in
  criticising Brazil for extending its list of products for which
  import licenses have been temporarily suspended, so as to
  improve its balance of payments.
      The United States charged Japan with violating GATT rules
  by restricting imports of agricultural products through an
  import licensing system. The United States asked for
  consultations with Tokyo on the issue.
      Tran charged that the trade measures contravened a
  political commitment to halt and reverse trade barriers,
  pledged by ministers in Punta del Este last September.
      When ministers established the four year Uruguay round to
  negotiate freer trade in 13 areas, they set up the GATT
  surveillance body to monitor this commitment, known in GATT
  jargon as ""standstill and rollback.""
      Tran criticised Washington for the ""superfund"" tax on oil
  imports, a customs user fee, and the removal of a special
  machine tool (known as category FSC34) from its government
  procurement list for reasons of national security.
      Warren Lavorel, a U.S. Trade official, defended the
  policies, saying they did not violate GATT trade rules.
      The surveillance body will send a record of today's talks
  to the Trade Negotiating Committee, which oversees the round,
  to decide any further action on the charges.
      The oil tax and customs user fee have already been the
  subject of formal GATT dispute panels set up outside the
  Uruguay Round to rule on the legality of the practices.
      The ruling GATT Council yesterday adopted a dispute panel's
  report and ruled that the U.S. Superfund tax on oil imports
  breached trade rules. It called on Washington to modify its
  legislation.
      Mexico and Canada, along with the European Community,

  farm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2.45 billion in 1990, for a
  total of 5.3 billion in saving over three years, sources said.
      The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculture
  committees with difficult choices on how to make changes in
  agriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targets
  without jeopardizing popular support payments, senior
  Congressional aides told Reuters.
      Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to find
  the budget savings.
      Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grains
  subcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheat
  and corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrs
  and 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs.
      House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza has
  said the committee will consider the Glickman proposal.
      But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to
  be approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers and
  a strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who said
  freezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major
  grain export competitors and would not achieve the budget
  savings Glickman claims.
      Another area where Glickman and other have said budget
  savings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program,
  ARP, levels for wheat and corn.
      However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong stand
  within the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 crop
  wheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30
  pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Most
  commodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail.
      Congressional sources said the only way to achieve
  significant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boost
  the 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source said
  singling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen as
  unfair to one commodity.
      Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is most
  likely to eventually look for budget savings are some
  tightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible 
  adoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains.
      Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billion
  but not enough, they said.
      Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculture
  committees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut on
  all Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including price
  support loans and deficiency payments, similar to the
  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.
      This idea has been suggested by the American Farm Bureau
  Federation, AFBF, as the fairest approach for all commodities.

['acq'],"OFFER FOR DOME MAY SHORT-CIRCUIT ITS DEBT TALKS
  A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome
  Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO>
  may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door
  for more takeover bids, oil analysts said.
      Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt
  of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim
  debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer
  substantial payments to creditors will expire.
      Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders
  that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan.
      Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as
  public noteholders in March after several months of delicate
  negotiations.
      TransCanada's proposal ""amounts to a quasi debt
  restructuring,"" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker
  Ltd said from Toronto.
      Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow
  creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet
  to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to
  cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.
      ""The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that
  even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that
  Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,""
  said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in
  Calgary.
      TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome
  was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed
  refinancing packages, Gobert said.
      The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome
  since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders
  to agree to a restructuring, he added.
      ""I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain
  any and all offers (for Dome),"" Gobert said.
      Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that
  TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix
  the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other
  possible buyers from making an offer. ""By drawing attention to
  us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little
  reluctant to come forward,"" he said.
      Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal
  offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a
  confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.
      Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions
  with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other
  unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and
  financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including
  TransCanada's.
      Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price
  for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.
      However, he said not enough financial details are known
  about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of
  TransCanada's proposed offer.

  contained no wage increase.
      The locals' bargaining committees are expected to meet and
  prepare for the reopening of negotiations with Cominco, he
  said.
      The three locals cover about 2,600 production and
  maintenance workers at Cominco's Trail smelter and Kimberley,
  B.C. lead-zinc mine.
      Output at both sites has been shut down since the
  production and maintenance workers, along with about 600 office
  and technical workers, went on strike May 9.
      The two Steelworkers locals representing the office and
  technical workers have not negotiated since May 21.
      The strike caused Cominco to declare force majeure, which
  means the company may not be able to honor contracts for
  products from the smelter and mine.
      Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all of
  which expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.
      The union had requested a three pct wage increase in each

"['acq', 'copper']","PHELPS DODGE &lt;PD> SETS SIGHTS ON ACQUISITION
  Phelps Dodge Corp chairman G. Robert
  Durham said the company is prepared to make another large
  non-copper acquisition and that a deal could be struck in the
  near future.
      In an interview with Reuters, Durham said the company was
  examining potential candidates but not yet talking with any.
      He declined to name the companies but said a deal could
  occur as soon as the second half of 1987.
     
      Phelps Dodge, which ranks as the largest copper producer in
  the U.S., last year paid 240 mln dlrs for Columbian Chemicals
  Co, a maker of carbon black which is used in rubber and tires
  among other products.
      The purchase was part of a strategic plan to diversify and
  eventually match earnings from non-copper operations and copper
  operations.
      Phelps Dodge could spend between 250 mln and 500 mln dlrs
  to buy another non-copper company, Durham said, citing about
  100 mln dlrs of cash and 580 mln dlrs of untapped bank credit.
     
      Any acquisition candidate would have to have a different
  economic cycle than copper, substantial earnings and good
  management, he said. Phelps Dodge would only want a friendly
  deal, he added.
      ""We're not talking high-tech, or financial services or
  about a perfume company,"" he said. ""We want a good basic
  industrial company that will fit into our management
  structure,"" Durham said.
     
      During the interview, Durham and other executives also said
  continued strong demand and tight copper supply should lead to
  higher prices for the metal.
      ""In my view, it's not a matter of if but when the price
  (for copper) will improve because there aren't that many new
  projects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession,
  will continue to grow modestly,"" said executive vice president
  Douglas Yearley. Phelps Dodge continues to lower its cost of
  producing copper, the executives said. Costs should be below 50
  cents a pound, after depreciation but before interest and
  corporate expense, by 1989 or 1990.
      Production costs are about 56 to 57 cents a pound now
  compared to one dlr a pound in 1981, some Wall St analysts
  said.
      Durham said copper supplies are lower than they have been
  for almost 20 years and demand continued to be strong.
      He declined to project results for the second quarter or
  year. But he said the quarter was going well and the rise in
  copper prices in the last month will help results.
      Durham said last month that the second quarter should match
  the first quarter when earnings rose about 11 pct to 16.8 mln
  dlrs or 49 cts a share.
      First quarter sales rose 61.5 pct to 372.9 mln dlrs,
  reflecting the acquisition of Columbian Chemicals and increased
  copper shipments from the Chino copper mine in New Mexico, also
  acquired last year.
      Analysts are projecting 1987 earnings of 2.20 dlrs to 2.75
  dlrs a share, up sharply from 1.79 dlrs in 1986.

"['bop', 'gnp', 'trade']","JAPAN TRADE SURPLUS WILL GROW AGAIN IN 1987, OECD
  Japan's trade surplus is likely to
  continue to grow in 1987, as sales of Japanese goods abroad
  increase while domestic demand remains sluggish, the
  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
  said.
      In its latest half-yearly review of the world economy, the
  OECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus last
  year, when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 while
  export markets rose by only two pct.
      But it said this differential between the growth of
  domestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988,
  ""thus weakening the international adjustment process.""
      It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over two
  pct but with a rise in exports of 3.3 pct in 1987 and 3.6 pct
  in 1988. As a result, the current account surplus in 1987 will
  rise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986, although in
  1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs.
      The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6,000 billion
  yen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demand
  and increase imports to Japan. However, OECD officials said the
  measures will significantly strengthen domestic demand, quite
  possibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects have
  worked through, and thus will provide some stimulus to imports.
      The OECD outlook said, ""Continued large current account
  surpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantial
  net external asset position could well lead to upward pressure
  on the yen."" It said that further appreciation could then lead
  manufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus
  weaken domestic growth.
      The OECD said Japan's Gross National Product was likely to
  gorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988, below 1986's 2.5 pct
  growth. But it said Japan would continue its good performance
  on inflation, with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a
  0.6 pct rise in consumer prices last year.

  Recent government moves to curb capital
  inflow have temporarily helped to slow the rise of Taiwan's
  foreign exchange reserves and to stabilise the local dollar
  against the U.S. Currency, officials and bankers said.
      Central bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the
  reserves rose only about 500 mln U.S. Dlrs in the past two
  weeks and the local dollar appreciated more slowly against the
  U.S. Dollar.
      Chang said, ""The pace of increase in our reserves is much
  slower now than before and our currency is getting more stable.""
  He said the reserves, mainly the result of the trade surplus
  with the U.S., Rose at the rate of two to three billion U.S.
  Dlrs a month between January and May.
      The reserves, the world's third largest after Japan and
  West Germany, now total well over 60 billion U.S. Dlrs.
      On June 2 the central bank froze overseas borrowings of
  local and foreign banks and cut the limit on central bank
  purchases of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40 pct from 90
  pct of the value of a contract.
      Local and foreign bankers said the June 2 measures had
  drastically limited their ability to lend foreign exchange to
  importers and exporters.
      They said their overseas borrowings and forward dollar
  transactions showed a drastic decline with some banks
  registering a fall of up to 30 pct.
      Bank dealers said the Taiwan dollar has stabilised against
  the U.S. Currency this week after rising two to five Taiwanese
  cents a day between June 2 and 13 compared with a rise of five
  to eight cents in May.
      The bank dealers said the central bank, which had
  previously bought U.S. Dollars heavily, sold at least 1.1
  billion U.S. Dlrs in the past two weeks to meet commercial
  demand.
      They said they expected the government to keep the local
  dollar stable in the near term to give breathing space to
  businesses experiencing slower exports because of the rise of
  more than 23 pct in the value of the Taiwan dollar since
  September 1985.
      The Taiwan dollar opened at 31.09 to the U.S. Dollar today,
  unchanged from yesterday.
      Keh Fei-Lo, vice president of First Commercial Bank, said,
  ""It appears the central bank's move to curb the capital inflow
  is quite successful.""
      Vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said the slower
  rise in foreign exchange reserves would help ease pressure from
  Washington over the large U.S. Trade deficit with Taiwan.
      Over the past year Taiwanese businessmen have delayed
  imports of machinery and production equipment because of
  exchange rate uncertainty, he said. The stable exchange rate

  The current crude oil price of between

  of years, rising only one to two dlrs a barrel per annum to
  keep up with inflation, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said.
      Lukman, who was speaking during talks with Swedish trade
  officials, said the stable price depended upon output restraint
  by both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, Swedish government
  officials said.
      They said Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, made
  the remarks whilst talking about the connection between Third
  World debt and industrialised nations.
      Crude oil output controls did not necessarily mean higher
  energy bills for the world's industrial nations, Lukman said.
      Although very low oil prices, such as those seen around the
  beginning of the year, may appear beneficial for the industrial
  countries that depend on imported energy, they would only lead
  to wastage and overdependence on the fuel in the long term, he
  said.
      This in turn would bring a swing back to extremely high
  prices, he added.

['crude'],"TEXACO &lt;TX> SAYS SOME OIL FLOWS RE-ESTABLISHED
  Texaco Inc has re-established some key
  oil supply lines following yesterday's court filing for
  protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankrupcty code, said
  Elton Yates, Texaco's coordinator of worldwide operations.
      ""Several companies say they are willing to start trading,""
  Yates told Reuters in an interview.
      The company last week had stated that a number of domestic
  and international oil suppliers were demanding cash for oil
  shipments, and in some cases, had cut supplies altogether.
  Banks had also cut credit lines, it said in court filings.
      Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC> and other banks told
  Texaco it would cut off a one billion dlr credit line, Texaco
  said in the court filing. Chase Manhattan Corp &lt;CMB> and J.P.
  Morgan Co's &lt;JPM> Morgan Guaranty Trust Co asked for deposits
  to cover transactions, it said.
      The severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arose
  from an unfavorable ruling last Monday by the U.S. Supreme
  Court in Texaco's ongoing dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL> over
  the acquisition of Getty Oil Co in 1984.
      The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco's
  plea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case.
      ""Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as they
  could,"" Elton said. But following Monday's Supreme Court
  ruling, Texaco's suppliers began demanding cash and halting
  supplies.
      ""It wasn't until last Wednesday that it turned into an
  avalanche,"" he said. ""Supplies were cut to the point where we
  could not run the system at anywhere near capacity.""
      He said less than half of Texaco's oil supplies had been in
  jeapordy, but the cut off would have produced severe shortages
  by mid-May. Now the situation appears much less severe, Elton
  said.
      It said that Sonatrach, the Algerian national oil company,
  canceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas,
  Occidental Petroleum Co &lt;OXY> demanded cash for crude, and
  Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC> asked for special safeguards.
      The company also said British Petroleum Co PLC &lt;BP> last
  week refused to accept an order for fuel oil. But Yates today
  said, ""a big U.K. company has in fact said they would go on
  supplying. They had cancelled last week.""
      He declined to identify the company.
      &lt;Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.>, the Venezuelan state oil
  company that supplies a large portion of Texaco's oil, also
  halted shipments two weeks ago, Yates said.
      But he added that Texaco expected to meet with the
  Venezuelans later today in an attempt to reestablish that key
  supply line. Talks were also expected to take place with the
  Algerians, he added.
      Bankruptcy specialists said it was likely Texaco's chapter
  11 filing would allow the company to secure its credit lines
  and oil supplies that are key to the company's business.
      ""It will be business as usual for Texaco,"" said Martin
  Klein, a bankruptcy attorney at the New York law firm Dreyer
  and Traub.
      ""Creditors are a nervous bunch of people,"" he said. ""But
  when the dust settles they will reevaluate the situation and
  will likely extend credit to the chapter 11 company.""
      But other officials at Texaco were not immediately
  available to say whether discussions were being held with its
  banks, or whether credit lines had been reestablished.

['interest'],"U.K. CREDIT POLICY SEEN STEADY, DESPITE BANK DATA
  An unexpectedly heavy 4.4 billion stg
  surge in U.K. September sterling bank lending is unlikely to
  nudge the Bank of England towards tightening monetary policy as
  long as sterling remains in its present robust state,
  economists said.
      An acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over the
  past two days will in any case subdue personal consumer credit
  demand which has largely been behind growth in lending.
      ""In the normal course of events the markets would have been
  extremely worried about that figure,"" noted Peter Spencer, U.K.
  Economist with Credit Suisse First Boston.
      After an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data,
  which compared won stg August rise, U.K.
  Government bonds (gilts) soared as investors continued to flee
  from plummetting equities into the relative security of
  government securities.
      Equity markets dropped sharply on the news, touching a
  day's low of 1,766.7 on the FTSE 100 index after the data,
  before staging a recovery. Sterling held its buoyant tone
  throughout.
      U.K. Money market rates, in a similarly calm response,
  resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morning
  after little more than a token blip as the figures came out.
      Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by banks
  would under other circumstances have prompted market fears of a
  rise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct, ""With
  the financial markets doing what they're doing, that's the last
  thing the Bank of England would want to do,"" Spencer said.
      ""The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long as
  sterling is firm, the authorities are unlikely to put rates up,""
  said Kevin Boakes, chief U.K. Economist at Greenwell Montagu
  Gilt Edged. Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow money
  measure M0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from August's 4.5 pct
  growth, which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury.
      But ""The fact that overall broad money growth has slowed
  down is a rather encouraging sign,"" noted Paul Temperton, U.K.
  Economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. He pointed to a
  fall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad money
  aggregate to 19.5 pct in September from August's 22 pct.
      It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bank
  of England to engineer a one point rise in U.K. Bank base rates
  to 10 pct in early August, caution endorsed subsequently by
  news of a massive 4.9 billion stg July rise in bank lending.
      Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry in
  that period had been the behaviour of U.K. Asset markets.
      Housing and equities were the key two asset markets in
  influencing consumer behaviour, he said.
      In the light of the precipitous falls on U.K. Equity
  markets in the past few days, ""There will almost certainly be a
  straightforward impact on consumer spending and on retail
  sales,"" Temperton said.
      ""Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth in
  consumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues,"" he added.
      ""I think the stock market has decided that the bank lending
  figure is a thing of the past...We are talking about a very
  serious panic and a flight to quality,"" Spencer said.
      A U.K. Treasury official said that it was important to look
  at all the monetary information, not just the bank lending,
  adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowly
  than bank lending.
      Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lending
  was evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavy
  personal sector borrowing.
      Figures from the Banking Information Service showed
  personal sector lending by U.K. Clearing banks rose by 1.66
  billion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise. Much
  of the rise reflected quarterly interest payments.

  Bangladesh's trade gap is expected to
  widen in fiscal 1987/88 beginning on July 1 after the
  government relaxed restrictions on some imports including
  luxury cars.
      The country has set its export target for the year at 1.1
  billion U.S. Dlrs against imports of 1.805 billion dlrs,
  compared with 1986/7's one billion dlrs of export earnings and
  1.113 billion dlrs of imports.
      Commerce Minister Mohammad Abdul Munim said the changes
  were aimed at encouraging export oriented industries to boost
  foreign exchange earnings and imports of essential machinery
  and raw materials, to increase industrial production.
      The government was easing procedures to enhance incentives
  especially for exporters of textiles and frozen food and
  importers of industrial machinery and raw materials, Munim told
  reporters.
      Commerce Ministry officials told Reuters the import policy
  covered only commercial imports amounting to 1.805 billion
  dlrs. Imports of capital machinery and foodgrains by the
  government were not included in the policy, they added.
      They said the country's total import bill (both commercial
  and other imports) was expected to reach 2.7 billion dlrs in
  the new year compared with 2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87.
      The minister said ending restrictions on imports of cars
  and dropping 50 pct sales tax on small cars would not harm the
  economy.
      Munim said Bangladesh feared a further drop in prices for
  its main export jute, ""which will certainly affect our export
  earnings"" in the coming year.
      Bangladesh's jute exports fell to 410 mln dlrs from 500 mln
  in 1986/87, according official figures.
      But Munim said exports of non-traditional items, which
  accounted for over 40 pct of total exports this year, would
  play a key role in achieving the 1987/88 export target.

"['grain', 'wheat']","NO PRESSING NEED FOR SOVIET WHEAT SUBSIDY - LYNG
  The Soviets have not indicated an
  urgent need for a U.S. wheat subsidy offer, and it is unlikely
  that such an offer will be ma during the U.S./Soviet summit
  expected to be held next month, Agriculture Secretary Richard
  Lyng told Reuters.
      In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Lyng said he did
  not know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheat
  subsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made.
      ""Last year it was well into the year before we offered it.
  There's been nothing that's taken place to indicate to me that
  there's a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (a
  wheat subsidy).""
      When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a U.S./Soviet
  summit, Lyng said, ""No, I don't think so. I don't think that.""
      The Agriculture Secretary said a U.S. wheat subsidy deal to
  Moscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate for
  discussion at a summit.
      ""It would not be the kind of issue that the President or the
  Chairman would get into specific negotiations or discussions
  about,"" Lyng said.
      ""When Mr. Nikonov (communist party secretary for
  agriculture) was here ... he indicated that trade in wheat was
  not something that would be discussed with the President of the
  United States. He said it's not presidential,"" Lyng said.
      Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some major
  producing areas of the world, volatile wheat prices and the
  still unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any final
  decision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow.
      The future of the U.S./Soviet long-term grains agreement
  will be discussed the first of next year, Lyng said, but the
  Agriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of the
  long-standing agreement.
      ""We've had three years in a row in which the Soviets have
  failed to live up to their end of the agreement ... We would
  love to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union,
  but do we need a long-term agreement. Who benefits from that.
  These are some of the questions we need to discuss.""
      When asked if he felt the United States has benefitted from
  the agreement, Lyng said, ""I don't know. It certainly hasn't
  been what we had hoped it would be. For three years running
  they've (Moscow) failed to live up to what we considered was an
  agreement.""

['crude'],"NORWAY EXTENDS 7.5 PCT OIL OUTPUT CUT - MINISTRY
  Norway will extend its 7.5 pct cutback in
  planned North Sea oil output in support of OPEC from July 15
  until the end of this year, Oil Ministry spokesman Egil Helle
  told Reuters.
      ""We took a very positive view of the OPEC meeting in Vienna,""
  he said. ""The accord reached there means stability in the oil
  market and we shall continue making our contribution.""
      The cuts, originally brought in from February 1, would
  probably be officially approved on July 10 by parliament, Helle
  said. The ministry had written to Norway's oil companies and
  would now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts.
      OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of
  16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 and
  retained the fixed prices that were set in its December accord
  based on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point.
      OPEC's first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, and
  it's December pact had provisionally set a third quarter
  ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourth
  quarter.
      Norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshore
  fields, previously said it would continue its output curbs from
  planned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remained
  within its December accord on output and prices.
      Norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around
  840,000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mln
  bpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995.
      The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented since
  February reduced Norway's oil output by about 80,000 bpd.
      Norway's Oil Minister Arne Oeien, currently in Iceland for
  a meeting of Nordic ministers, has made no official statement
  on the latest oil production cutbacks.
      Over the past year several other leading non-OPEC
  producers, including the Soviet Union, Mexico, China, Malaysia
  and Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC's bid to keep
  prices stable.
      Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following an
  OPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around
  18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December.
      Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total export
  earnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil price
  during the first half of 1986.
      But firmer oil prices since then have brought some
  stability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign trade
  deficit.
       Norway's North Sea neighbour Britain has consistently
  refused to cooperate with OPEC output cuts saying it is up to
  the producing oil companies to set the levels of production.

"['carcass', 'livestock', 'sugar', 'trade']","U.S. TAKES TOUGH STAND ON GATT FARM ISSUES
  The United States is prepared to ""pull out
  all the stops"" to defend its agricultural trade rights under the
  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), U.S. Ambassador
  to GATT Michael Samuels said.
      Those rights are now being challenged by the European
  Community's (EC) agricultural support policies, he told a
  conference sponsored by the American Soybean Association.
      He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate if
  the EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef without
  the issue being investigated by a GATT special committee.
      The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effect
  on January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meat
  shipments into the EC.
      The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S.
  trade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseed
  prices over the current market level and which may be extended
  to include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said.
      Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies,
  an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral trade
  negotiations, ""is meaningless if import barriers continue to be
  erected,"" Samuels said.
      Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farm
  subsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, ""visionary""
  and ""very serious.""  The EC and Japan have said it is
  unrealistic.
      The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposal
  on farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formally
  next week.
      The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reduce
  tensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cereals
  substitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction of
  farm subsidies.
      The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long as
  they are directly linked to long-term commitments to end major
  trade distortions, Samuels said.
      Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formally
  submitted and respond to it officially then.
      ""We will consider its relation to the Punta del Este
  declaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,""
  the U.S. Ambassador said.
      The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignores
  the U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added.
      The key difference between the two approaches is that the
  U.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushing
  only for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said.
      If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze,
  there would be little incentive for the Community to work to
  correct the international trade situation, he added.
      Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the EC
  oilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports to
  third countries as three crucial barriers to trade which the
  U.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT.

  &lt;STAT.OL>, operator on Norway's North Sea Veslefrikk oil field,

  crowns with two domestic yards, the company said in a
  statement.
      Moss Rosenberg Verft, a subsidiary of Kvaerner Industrier
  A/S &lt;KVIO.OL> won a 1.2 billion crown contract to convert
  Statoil's semisubmersible rig West Vision to a floating
  production platform and to build the deck for a separate, fixed
  well-head platform to be placed on the field, it said.
      Statoil said Aker Verdal, a unit of Aker Norcem A/S
  &lt;AMVO.OL>, won a 300-mln crown contract to design and build the
  well-head platform's 10,000-tonne steel substructure, to stand
  in 150 metres of water next to the converted rig.
      Statoil said using a floating production unit rather than a
  fixed platform would cut construction time, enabling field
  partners to bring Veslefrikk on stream in late 1989 -- several
  months earlier than previously planned.
      Veslefrikk, with estimated recoverable reserves of 258 mln
  barrels oil and 140 billion cubic feet gas, is located 145 km
  west of Bergen.
      Statoil estimates the field's total development cost,
  including drilling, at 6.6 billion crowns. Planned daily output
  is 65,000 barrels oil and 35 mln cubic feet gas.
      Veslefrikk's oil will be landed via the nearby Oseberg
  field pipeline at the Sture crude terminal near Bergen. Its gas
  will be fed into the Statpipe line, which gathers gas from
  Norway's Statfjord, Gullfaks and Oseberg fields.

  U.S. And West German reaffirmation of
  support for the Louvre Accord cannot cure the fundamental
  problems bedevilling the world economy which lie behind the
  current collapse in stock markets, London economists said.
      ""There's going to have to be some acknowledgement that the
  dollar is going to be allowed to slip,"" said Richard Jeffrey of
  Hoare Govett. ""If not, there is going to be continued fear that
  when pressure emerges on the dollar, the Fed will be forced to
  tighten. This throws up the economic abyss of recession in the
  U.S. With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world.""
      But some economists added that Wall Street's crash, which
  dragged other major markets down with it, may help curb the
  very problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflation
  fears and the massive and persistent U.S. Trade deficits.
      ""If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street
  ...It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide,"" said
  Geoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments from
  other London and Tokyo analysts.
      Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of
  further falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationary
  pressures and import demand in the U.S., They say.
      Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the
  equity crash, according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson.
      ""It would be suicidal for any government in the context of
  what happened in the last couple of days to jack up their
  interest rates,"" he added.
      Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime
  lending rate half a point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fed
  chairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financial
  system.
      The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock
  collapse would spill over into the economy, via a banking
  crisis for example, thus precipitating recession.
      It also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of
  1.8200 marks from a European low of 1.7880. But economists said
  today's whiplash moves do not have long term significance and
  that markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals in
  mind.
      ""The United States has been able to live on borrowed time.
  If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economic
  growth not recession...It contains good news (and) provides a
  more realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy,"" said Capel's
  Dennis. But he added that markets are still very much in
  danger.
      ""The liquidity doesn't disappear...All it's doing is
  disappearing from the equity markets,"" Dennis noted.
      David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said world
  market turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven
  (G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar,
  as implied by West German Finance Minister Gerhard
  Stoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support currencies
  is still on.
      Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered by
  expectations that the Germans were more worried about the money
  supply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency
  stability.
      But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad, said
  Morrison. ""The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived. To
  stabilise the dollar at too high a level is wrong,"" he said.

      The price, quoted for the first time yesterday, was

"['dlr', 'dmk', 'money-fx', 'yen']","LOUVRE ACCORD STILL IN EFFECT, JAPAN OFFICIAL SAYS
  The Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations
  still comply with last February's Louvre accord to stabilize
  currencies, a senior Bank of Japan official said.
      And U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's remarks at the
  weekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lower
  range for the dollar, other senior officials from the Bank of
  Japan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews.
      ""The exchange market is apparently reacting too much, and
  anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it
  later on,"" the Bank of Japan official told Reuters.
      The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk the
  dollar down. A lower dollar would harm the U.S. Economy, he
  noted.
      A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved in
  monetary talks with other nations also said the U.S. Would
  never attempt to lower the reference range for the dollar
  against the mark or the yen.
      The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between
  140-150 yen and between 1.70 and 1.90 marks.
      The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 1.7730/35 marks and
  141.35 yen.
      ""Behind Baker's remark was U.S. Frustration over higher
  interest rates abroad, especially in West Germany, but this
  does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework
  of the Louvre accord,"" the Finance Ministry official said.
      He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid any
  further rise in U.S. Interest rates because it would not only
  hurt the U.S. Economy but aggravate the Third World debt
  problem.
      Higher U.S. Interest rates would merely raise their
  interest payment burden and depress U.S. Stock and bond markets
  further, the monetary officials said.
      Both the ministry and central bank officials, who declined
  to be named, noted the U.S. No longer wants to see a further
  decline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationary
  expectations in the U.S.
      ""That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvre
  agreement is still operative,"" the senior ministry official
  said.
      Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday that
  Washington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of West
  Germany's increase in short-term interest rates.
      The market at first interpreted this as indicating the U.S.
  Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollar
  decline further unless surplus countries, notably West Germany,
  try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in the
  accord, foreign exchange dealers said.
      But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additional
  statement that ""the Louvre agreement is still operative,"" and
  this caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today, the
  dealers said.
      Uncertainty, however, remained the flavour of the day in
  Tokyo currency markets.
      The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguised
  pressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rates
  higher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance,
  or international economic policy coordination.
      The G-7, comprising the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,
  France, Italy and Canada, have agreed to monitor each other's
  economic policies and from time to time apply ""peer pressure"" to
  persuade others to change their policies to a desired course,
  they noted. ""Without such a basic agreement of multilateral
  surveillance, Baker would never have criticized the West German
  policy so openly,"" the ministry official said.
      The U.S.-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policy
  should thus be regarded as a process of healthy policy
  coordination and not as any indication of a possible collapse
  of the Louvre agreement, the official said.
      He also said Japan has not received any specific request
  from the U.S. On its monetary policy, although its short-term
  money rates have been edging higher.
      ""This is because we, unlike the Germans, are not taking
  policy to guide interest rates higher, and the marginal rate
  rise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons,"" he
  added.

  seeking public comments on the question of adjusting the
  Commodity Credit Corporation's (CCC) discount and premium
  schedules to improve the quality of grain it accepts as loan
  collateral or under price support programs.
      The premiums and discounts schedule are based on quality
  factors such as moisture content and kernel damage. The
  schedule stipulates the premiums and discounts used for valuing
  grain the CCC accepts or purchases during the year.
      The department said it is possible that producers could be
  encouraged to delivery higher quality grain to CCC by adjusting
  the premiums and discounts.
      Comments are due by April 24 and a report to Congress is
  required by law by May 10.

['veg-oil'],"ACP STATES SAY EC OILS TAX PLAN BREAKS ACCORDS
  Developing countries said the European
  Community (EC) would breach two international agreements if it
  went ahead with its plans for an oils and fats tax.
      Ambassadors to the EC from African, Caribbean and Pacific
  (ACP) states told a press conference the tax would hit the
  exports of 26 ACP countries.
      They said the EC failed to follow consultation procedures
  laid down in the Lome Convention which regulates relations
  between ACP states and the bloc for moves which could affect
  trade between the two sides.
      They also said the EC would be in breach of an undertaking
  not to bring in new protectionist measures during the current
  Punta del Este round of world trade negotiations being held
  under GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) auspices.
      The EC Commission has proposed a tax of up to 330 European
  currency units (Ecus) a tonne on both imported and EC-produced
  vegetable and marine fats for human consumption, which could
  raise up to two billion Ecus a year.
      EC farm ministers, who would have to approve such a tax,
  are split on the issue and are expected to decide it at a
  marathon meeting on EC farm prices beginning in Luxembourg on
  June 15.
      Jamaican ambassador Leslie Wilson said ACP countries are
  convinced this would lead to EC industry substituting products
  made within the bloc for oil and fat imports. The ACP estimates
  this would result in a fall of 160 to 185 mln Ecus in its
  member country exports.
      ""We can't believe the EC would willingly take measures to
  undermine our countries, but such would be the impact of these
  measures,"" Wilson said.
      The U.S. and Malaysia say their exports would also be hit
  by the proposed tax and they may take retaliatory action if it
  is approved.
      Wilson said the ACP would take such steps only ""as a very
  last resort,"" but added that the ACP is in touch with other
  countries which oppose the plan.
      Wilson, who was chairing the news conference, made it clear
  Jamaica itself would not be hit by the tax as it does not
  export oils and fats.
      Among the worst hit countries would be Ivory Coast,
  Senegal, Nigeria and Papua New Guinea, the ACP says.

['acq'],"ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING TOPS CRAZY EDDIE OFFER
  A quickly growing Texas-based
  distributor of electronics products offered 240 mln dlrs
  for Crazy Eddie Inc &lt;crzy>, the leading New York City
  electronics retailer, or one dlr per share more than its
  founder has bid.
      The 8-dlr-a-share offer by Entertainment Marketing Inc &lt;em>
  for Crazy Eddie comes less than two weeks after founder Eddie
  Antar and a firm controlled by the Belzbergs of Canada
  announced a bid to take the 32-store Crazy Eddie chain private.
      Analysts said Entertainment Marketing, whose revenues and
  profits quadrupled in 1986, may be looking to break into the
  highly competitive New York City retail market for consumer
  electronics, the nation's biggest, at a time the fortunes of
  electronics retailers have sagged.
      The analysts questioned whether Houston-based Entertainment
  Marketing, founded by a former electronics retailer but whose
  present buinesses are primarily as wholesale distributors, had
  the management expertise for retailing or was merely trying to
  drive up the price of the Crazy Eddie shares it already owns.
      ""I have mixed feelings,"" said analyst Dennis Telzrow of
  Eppler, Geurin and Turner, a Dallas brokerage. ""On the one hand
  it's probably a cheap price. On the other hand, does
  Entertainment Marketing have the management talent to run it
  and will the Crazy Eddie people leave?""
      ""It's a risky strategy for Entertainment Marketing,"" said
  analyst Eliot Laurence of Wessels Arnold and Henderson, a
  Minneapolis brokerage. ""Electronics retailing is very management
  concentrated; they'd want to keep Crazy Eddie's management in
  place.""
      Laurence said that, since Entertainment Marketing already
  owns 4.3 percent of Crazy Eddie's 31.3 million shares, it may
  be trying to get the Antar-Belzberg group to increase its
  7-dlr-a-share offer.
      Shares of Crazy Eddie, which have jumped from the high
  4-dlr range to above 7 dlrs since the Antar-Belzberg bid was
  announced May 20, rose another 50 cents Monday to 8.375 a share
  in over-the- counter trading. 
      Antar, the reclusive founder of the chain in the New York
  City, Philadelphia and Connecticut areas, said last month that
  his group controlled 14 percent of Crazy Eddie's shares.
      A Crazy Eddie spokesman said the company's board has taken
  no decision on the Antar-Belzberg offer, worth some 187 mln dlrs
  since they own more shares than Entertainment Marketing. He
  would not comment on the new offer.
      Entertainment Marketing sells computer products such as
  disk drives and other, often discounted electronics goods to
  retailers, primarily in the southwest, and directly to
  consumers by cable television.
      In fiscal 1986, ending last January, its revenues rose to
  87.9 mln dlrs from 21.3 mln dlrs the previous year. Net profit
  went to 3.2 mln dlrs from 750,000 dlrs in 1985.
      Entertainment Marketing, whose chief executive officer,
  Elias Zinn, once ran an electronics retailing business, said in
  a statement it had committed 50 mln dlrs toward the purchase
  of Crazy Eddie and had retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc to
  assist in financing the balance.
      Analyst Telzerow estimated that the company would have to
  borrow about 100 mln dlrs to complete the proposed buyout since
  Crazy Eddie has cash and other assets worth about the same
  amount.
      Shares of Entertainment Marketing were up 12.5 cents Monday
  to 9.50.

  The House Armed Services Committee
  has voted for a transfer in the management of stockpiled
  materials for national defense to the U.S. Defense Secretary.
      The committee also voted for legally-binding quantity and
  quality requirements on the materials, mostly metals.
      The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Bill
  which will be voted on in the House next month.
      The purpose of the measures, passed by the committee
  yesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discourage
  sell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, a
  staff member of the committee told Reuters.
      ""They (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by being
  managed properly,"" said the staffer. ""Management of the stockpile
  over the last 10 years has been atrocious.""
      Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to a
  White House agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      The staffer said under the measures passed by the committee
  the Secretary of Defense would have more influence over
  decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials.
      The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrs
  worth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. The
  stockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.
      He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to manage
  the stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.
      These agencies included the Office of Management and Budget
  and the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said.
      The committee believed the shared involvement in stockpile
  management was counter-productive, he said.

  The European Community's farmers'
  pressure group Copa has urged EC farm ministers to agree a tax
  on vegetable proteins similar to the oils and marine fats tax
  which has already been proposed by the EC Commission.
      Copa president Hans Kjeldsen told a news conference on
  Tuesday he had also urged ministers to seek a similar mechanism
  for cereal substitutes.
      He was speaking after a meeting of farm leaders with the
  Danish foreign and agriculture ministers, who currently chair
  meetings of their EC colleagues.
      Kjeldsen said taxes on the products concerned would help
  the EC's budget problems and would provide some price stability
  for producers.
      This would in turn help the market position for certain
  crops of which the EC is a net importer such as oilseeds, peas
  and beans, but for which the Commission is now proposing severe
  output restrictions.
      A minority of EC ministers opposed to an oils and fats tax
  on imported and domestically produced oils and marine fats
  succeeded in blocking the idea during this year's annual EC
  price fixing.
      However, the EC Commission has said it maintains its
  proposals for a tax.
      Kjeldsen said Copa had urged the ministers to pursue
  international negotiations on farm trade with the aim of
  bridging the gap between EC and world prices.

"['cpi', 'gnp', 'jobs']","JOINT ACTION SAID VITAL TO BOOST WORLD GROWTH
  Prospects for world economic growth remain
  very sluggish, and coordinated action by western governments is
  urgently needed to restore business confidence, stabilize
  currencies and encourage investment, the Organization for
  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said here.
      ""The economic situation has deteriorated in recent months,
  and ... Slow growth, high unemployment and large payments
  imbalances are likely to persist,"" it said in one of its
  gloomiest reviews of the world economy in recent years.
      The gross national product (GNP) of the 24-nation bloc of
  western industrialised countries is forecast to grow by only
  2.25 pct both this year and next, even slower than last year's
  2.5 pct growth rate.
      ""We would like to see the aggregate for the OECD area
  comfortably exceeding three pct,"" David Henderson, head of the
  OECD's economics and statistics department, said.
      The OECD said that the dollar fall had led to rising
  inflation expectations and higher interest rates in the U.S.,
  Combining with world trade imbalances and the huge third world
  debt problem to increase the risks of a world economic
  downturn.
      ""At the same time, many of the conditions for faster growth
  remain favorable,"" it said, citing low inflation in most major
  countries, healthy corporate finances, generally lower interest
  rates, improvements in state budget positions and more flexible
  labor markets.
      But private sector confidence had been undermined by
  uncertainties over exchange rates, it said, and warned that ""for
  confidence to be restored, it is important for governments
  swiftly to implement internationally-agreed commitments.""
      This was a clear reference to last February's Louvre accord
  of the Group of Five nations plus Canada, analysts said.
      The OECD said that apparent disagreements among major
  countries on implementation of the Louvre accord had helped to
  undermine business confidence, and called on more active fiscal
  policies from the U.S., West Germany and Japan to slow demand
  in the U.S. And raise it in the other two countries.
      Henderson said the 6,000 billion yen package announced
  recently by the Japanese government to encourage public works
  and cut taxes would make a significant contribution to this
  process, though it was too early to estimate its precise
  impact.
      He said the measures will help strengthen Japan's domestic
  demand significantly, quite possibly exceeding one pct of GNP.
      The inflation outlook, while broadly satisfactory, has
  worsened in recent months, with OECD consumer prices forecast
  to rise 3.5 pct this year and 3.75 pct in 1988 after a 2.8 pct
  increase in 1986.
      There is no prospect for any significant improvement in the
  unemployment situation over the next 18 months, with the
  average rate expected to stabilize at 8.25 pct, similar to last
  year.
      The OECD called for efforts to liberalize world
  agricultural markets through switching farm subsidies away from
  price guarantees and other measures linked to production
  towards direct income support for farmers.

['ship'],"U.S. HOUSE PASSES GULF BILL DESPITE OPPOSITION
  The U.S. House of Representatives 
  approved a bill that requires the Reagan administration to
  provide Congress with a report on its Gulf policy but does not
  place any restrictions on its actions.
      The bill passed 305-102 -- winning a necessary two-thirds
  of those voting -- despite a last-minute revolt by an alliance
  of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who sought to
  defeat it as a signal that a growing number of legislators
  oppose President Reagan's policies in the region.
      The legislation was passed in the wake of the May 17th
  Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf,
  which killed 37 Americans, and Reagan's decision to protect 11
  Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags --
  effectively making them American ships.
      The legislation -- supported by Congress' Democratic and
  Republican leadership as well as by the administration --
  required Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger to provide a
  report to Congress, within seven days of enactment, on plans to
  protect U.S. warships and flag ships in the Persian Gulf.
      It did not, however, place any restrictions on the
  administration as it proceeds to reflag the Kuwaiti ships and
  thus has no immediate effect on U.S. policy.
      The Senate was expected to approve the legislation this
  week. The bill would then be sent to Reagan for signature.
      Supporters of the bill said passage of the bill was only a
  first step toward a greater congressional involvement in
  formulating policy.
      But Democratic critics said the bill did not ask the
  administration to address tough policy questions in the report.

['cpi'],"PHILIPPINE INFLATION PREDICTED TO RISE
  The Philippine 1987 inflation rate will
  rise to 4.8 pct from 0.74 pct in 1986 if the government
  implements an employers' association recommendation for a 10
  pct increase in the 54 peso minimum daily wage this month,
  Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod said.
      The government's own proposal for an across-the-board daily
  pay rise of six pesos for non-agricultural workers and eight
  pesos for agriculture workers, would push the full year average
  higher to 5.4 pct, she told the Senate last week.
      The 10 pct rise in the minimum wage is recommended by the
  Employers Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP).
      The ECOP proposal would push the year-on-year inflation
  rate to 11.6 pct in December compared with the predicted 14.4
  pct if the government's recommendation is implemented, Solita
  said. Both were proposed last month.
      Annual inflation for 1987 was forecast at four to 4.5 pct
  by the National Economic and Development Authority early this
  month.
      In the first three months of the year, inflation was a
  negative 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 pct respectively, rising to 1.0, 2.5
  and 4.6 pct in April May and June, the National Statistics
  Office said.
      The annual inflation rate rose to 5.8 pct in June, 6.2 pct
  in July and 6.15 and 6.188 pct in August and September
  respectively, the National Statistics Office said.
      It attributed the acceleration to higher fuel and water
  prices.
      The government's six and eight peso wage increases would
  displace up to 20,000 workers, Monsod said, bringing the number
  of unemployed to 4.2 mln or 19.2 pct of the population.

['trade'],"U.S. STUDY SAYS TARIFFS AND QUOTAS COULD BACKFIRE
  The use of tariffs and quotas to
  reduce the flow of foreign goods into the United States will do
  little to cut the nation's swelling trade deficit, a government
  study said.
      In fact, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report said,
  such protectionist policies could make U.S. Products less
  competitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost of
  imported products that are re-exported in different forms.
      ""Such policies are much more likely to hurt, rather than
  help, the productive capabilities of the U.S. Economy,"" it said.
      The 218-page report, written by FTC economists John Hilke
  and Philip Nelson, blamed the rising trade shortfall, which
  climbed to a record 166.3 billion dlrs last year, on shifting
  currency exchange rates and growing U.S consumer demand.
      Other factors commonly blamed for the deficit, such as
  foreign trade practices, deteriorating U.S. Industrial
  competitiveness, high labour costs and government restrictions
  on mergers, added little to the problem, it said.
      ""Although each industry's competitiveness affects the level
  of imports and exports in that industry, in general we find
  that there have been no significant industry-specific changes
  affecting competitiveness that would explain the increase in
  the overall trade deficit,"" the study said.
      ""To the extent any government action is needed to deal with
  the trade deficits, policies should focus on economy-wide
  phenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth,""
  the FTC study said.
      Supporting its conclusion that broad-based economic shifts
  were the cause of the increase in the trade deficit, the report
  said it found that nearly all U.S. Industries lost some
  domestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s.
      It also said it found a ""fairly direct relationship"" between
  the increased trade deficit and the influence of shifting
  currency exchange rates, U.S. Economic growth and domestic
  demand for goods and services, which has outpaced foreign
  consumer demand.
      The study examined seven factors which have been commonly
  blamed for the trade deficit: foreign government subsidies and
  trade barriers to protect foreign industries, a lack of
  investment in U.S. Industry, declining research and development
  in U.S. Industry, high labour costs, union work rules, the oil
  prices rises of the 1970s and U.S. Antitrust regulations.
      In each case, the study found little or no evidence that
  the factor had any impact on the trade deficit.

  CIP Inc, wholly-owned by Canadian
  Pacific Ltd, is considering building a pulp mill in Texas which
  would use kenaf fibre instead of wood, CIP president Cecil
  Slenniken said in an interview.
       The kenaf plant is a member of the hibiscus family and was
  artificially developed several years ago. The plant, which has
  been grown in Southern Texas, reaches a height of 10 feet in
  three months and is said to produce better quality newsprint
  than wood pulp, a CIP official said.
       Slenniken said the company has commissioned studies for a
  200,000 tonne capacity pulp mill which would use the fibre but
  would need partners to begin the project.
      ""We are not yet ready to commit the hundreds of millions of
  dollars it would take for such a project,"" Slenniken said.
       He said CIP has been using the pulp on a trial basis to
  make newsprint containing 90 pct kenaf fibre and 10 pct
  softwood fibre at its Trois-Rivieres, Quebec plant.
      CIP, Canada's second largest newsprint producer, recently
  launched a 366 mln Canadian dlr newsprint mill at Gold River,
  British Columbia which is due begin producing 230,000 metric

['acq'],"BANK OF NEW YORK REAFFIRMS TERMS FOR IRVING &lt;V>
  The Bank of New York Corp &lt;BK> said it
  reaffirmed the terms of its offer for Irving Bank Corp despite
  the drop in the Bank of New York's share price to 30-1/8, a
  Bank of New York spokesman said.
      ""The offer still stands, we have not changed our offer,"" a
  Bank of New York spokesman said.
      Irving would not comment on how the drop in the market
  affects its position on the bid or whether it would buy back
  any of its own shares.
      Earlier this month, Irving rejected the bid as inadequate
  and said it wanted to retain its independence.
      In late September, Bank of New York offered 80 dlrs per
  share in cash for 47.4 pct of Irving. For the remaining 52.6
  pct, it offered an exchange of 1.9 shares of its shares for one
  Irving share.
      At that time, the stock purchase portion was worth close to
  80 dlrs per share, but now that portion is worth 53 dlrs per
  share for a net price of 68 dlrs, one analyst said.
      According to the prospectus offer, shareholders may tender
  for all cash or all shares on a first come, first serve basis.
      Analysts were mixed about how the stock price drop would
  affect the acquisition.
      ""If it gets to the Irving shareholders, they would approve
  it, but Irving hopes the offer won't go to the shareholders,""
  said Mark Alpert, banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc.
      ""And the market is saying the deal won't go through,""
  Alpert said.
      ""The transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed at
  present. If Irving wouldn't go with the offer at 80 dlrs a
  share, then they won't go at a lower price,"" another analyst
  said.
      The analyst also doubted that Bank of New York could afford
  to retain its original offer.
      However, industry sources were more uncertain about
  prospects for the deal.
      ""With Irving's price so low, Bank of New York's offer will
  look good to Irving shareholders,"" said Michael Flores, a
  consultant at Bank Earnings International, a consulting firm.
      The drop of Irving's share to 44 dlrs per share, which is
  about a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week, increases
  the chance that Bank of New York will succeed, Flores said.
      Analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likely
  to depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the banking
  industry.
      ""Bank takeovers are less likely because banks can't use
  their own stock to make acquisitions because their share price
  is too depressed,"" Alpert said.
      Since only banks can buy another bank, the only other
  possible acquirors would be a foreign bank, Alpert said.
      ""In the market drop the stock of acquirors got clobbered
  more than the acquirees,"" another analyst said.

  China's trade deficit in the first
  quarter fell to 1.05 billion dlrs from 3.04 billion in the same

      Zhang Zhongji, spokesman of the State Statistical Bureau,
  quoted the figures as showing exports rose 27 pct to 7.28
  billion dlrs and imports fell 5.1 pct to 8.33 billion.
      He said if imports of gifts, foreign aid items and
  materials for joint ventures are excluded, the deficit was only
  350 mln dlrs, and the surplus on invisibles was 700 mln. As a
  result, foreign exchange reserves increased somewhat from their
  level at end-1986, he said, but gave no figure.
      Official figures show the reserves at 10.514 billion dlrs
  at end-1986, down from 11.9 billion at end-1985.
      Zhang said one reason for the rise in exports was improved
  incentives to export firms, which are being allowed to retain
  more foreign exchange from the goods they sell.
      He said first quarter exports to Hong Kong and Macao rose
  35.5 pct to 2.48 billion dlrs and imports rose 55.3 pct to 1.46

['acq'],"SUMITOMO BANK AIMS AT QUICK RECOVERY FROM MERGER
  Sumitomo Bank Ltd &lt;SUMI.T> is certain to
  lose its status as Japan's most profitable bank as a result of
  its merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank, financial analysts said.
      Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9
  trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bank
  with an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, in
  October.
      But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsu
  told Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain its
  position.
      ""We'll be back in position in first place within three
  years,"" Komatsu said in an interview.
      He said that while the merger will initially reduce
  Sumitomo's profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expand
  Sumitomo's branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area where
  it has been relatively weak.
      But financial analysts are divided on whether and how
  quickly the gamble will pay off.
      Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in
  view of the smaller bank's large debts. Others argue the merger
  was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch
  network from scratch.
      The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has
  expanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business
  and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the
  wisdom of some of those moves.
      ""They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Now
  it's largely out of their hands,"" said Kleinwort Benson Ltd
  financial analyst Simon Smithson.
      Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to
  enter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American
  investment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.
      Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5
  pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at
  least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange
  personnel, or increase the business they do with each other.
      ""The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the
  Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,"" said one analyst.
      But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.
      ""U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,
  we can do various things. We only have to wait two or three
  years, not until the 21st century,"" Komatsu said.
      Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes
  into the securities business at home.
      Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan's
  version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial
  from investment banking.
      But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu
  said he hopes further deregulation will create new
  opportunities.
      ""We need to find new business chances,"" Komatsu said. ""In some
  cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust
  bank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want.""
      Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such
  domestic securities business as profitable government bond
  dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co
  Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.
      He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering
  the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank
  subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.
       The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to
  securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,
  following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European
  universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.
      But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar
  decision on a Gottardo subsidiary.
      ""We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed
  in two or three years,"" he said.
      Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand
  lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to
  replace disappearing demand from big business, he added.
      The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of
  time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the
  merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.
      ""It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,"" said
  Kleinwort's Smithson.
      ""After that, it's a question of absorbing and juggling
  around. It will be the next decade before we see if the
  strategy is right or wrong.""

  Trading on the London potato futures
  market will not be suspended, Richard Harris, Chairman of the
  London Potato Futures Association (LPFA), said in a statement
  to floor members.
      It was in response to strong representations by the Potato
  Marketing Board (PMB) complaining of a gross distortion of
  price which they say will result in large deliveries into the
  physical market when the April futures position expires.
      The PMB had sought an immediate suspension in futures
  trading and asked the LPFA to take action to restore the
  relationship between futures and physicals.
      Farmers and merchants have alleged a squeeze and cornering
  of the market but Harris pointed out that recent investigations
  by the Association of Futures Brokers and Dealers (AFBD), the
  International Commodities Clearing House (ICCH) and other
  parties, found no evidence to substantiate this.
      The main complaint from some sections of the physical
  market is what they say is an unrealistic futures premium over
  the PMB's average ex-farm price. April futures traded this
  morning between 168 and 170 stg per tonne compared with PMB's
  average price of 104 stg.
      Bill Englebright, joint secretary of the LPFA said there is
  a two-tier market for physical potatoes. He said quality
  potatoes are in short supply and prepackers have been paying
  between 145 and 165 stg per tonne for best samples. But lesser
  quality grades have traded below 100 stg.
      Some merchants fear that a large tonnage will be delivered
  against the April futures contract between now and the end of
  the month, and possibly disrupt the physical market.
      Harris said the LPFA rule book allows the management
  committee to take steps as necessary to correct any malpractice
  and he assured the committee is monitoring the situation.

  The official Soviet news agency Tass
  denounced a U.S. Attack on an Iranian oil-drilling platform in
  the Gulf on Monday as military adventurism and said it would
  bring no dividends to the Reagan administration.
      Tass commentator Mikhail Krutikhin said the administration
  had embarked on an adventurist path in order to deflect
  attention from the scandal in which the United States sold arms
  to Iran and the profits were diverted to Nicaraguan rebels.
      ""The confrontation is a fact now. What is obvious is that
  the latest military adventure will not bring political

  Monday, sparking diplomatic speculation that they were
  concerned with an urgent matter of foreign affairs.
      Soviet officials have previously criticized the United
  States for sending naval forces into the Gulf, saying their
  presence serves to increase tension.
      Moscow is officially neutral in the war between Iran and
  Iraq. It is a major arms supplier to Iraq but has also sought
  broader contacts with Iran in the last year.

"['coconut', 'coconut-oil', 'copra-cake', 'meal-feed', 'palm-oil', 'veg-oil']","PHILIPPINE COCONUT CHIEF TO LOBBY AGAINST EC TAX
  Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA)
  chairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later this
  month to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community
  (EC) levy on vegetable oil imports.
      ""I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is putting
  up this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countries
  like the Philippines,"" Romero said in an interview.
      He said he did not know how much support the levy had
  within the EC but he said he believed those originally opposed
  to the tax were under pressure to change their position.
      Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany, the
  Netherlands, Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax. But
  there was a danger some of them would be persuaded to change
  sides, and if that happened opposition could crumble.
      Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warning
  that copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained
  dangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical.
      He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin per
  million parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked to
  apply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copra
  cake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin.
      Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when it
  is not properly dried or ground.
      Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in
  London that the Philippines was doing its best to meet EC
  standards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally,
  but this was likely to take several years of research.
      Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of total
  coconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs.
      Romero said he would also visit Oxford University's
  department of agricultural economics to discuss ways of
  avoiding the copra process altogether.
      ""There are ways of producing coconut products outside of
  copra,"" Romero said. ""We can process fresh coconut without drying
  the meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can process
  coconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go to
  the chemical root.""
      He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries to
  become more protectionist and he expected export prices of
  coconut products to drop.
      ""In the long term we will be getting less and less for more
  and more production, and I'm not comfortable with that,"" he
  said.
      With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping up
  production of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oil
  output had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said.
      ""To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spending
  billions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil by
  saying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,""
  he said.
      Romero said he expected coconut product export prices to
  stay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch a
  high of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents,
  and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents.
      Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-year
  coconut production cycle which showed production tended to fall
  after two successive years of good harvests.
      He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, to
  add to the production fall, drought had affected output.
      ""Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought the
  prices will start declining again. The only sure way to keep
  prices stable is by processing, adding more value,"" he said.
      Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop by
  planting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said.
      ""A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on
  10,000 square metres of land. That's a lot of space,"" Romero
  said. He said the government's proposed land reform program
  would exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because they
  had less than the proposed seven-hectares of land.
      ""If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels,
  production and employment then it won't happen,"" he said.
      PCA figures show about one-third of the country's
  population is dependent on the coconut industry.
      Coconuts are planted on about 3.2 mln hectares or
  one-fourth of total agricultural land.

  Canada plans to monitor steel shipments

  used as a backdoor to the U.S. market by offshore suppliers,""
  Carney said.
      Carney also said Canadian companies were being asked to

      Carney told the House of Commons she will soon announce an

      Officials of First Boston Inc, Harcourt's financial
  adviser, declined comment.
      A Wall Street arbitrageur, who owns Harcourt shares, said
  the rumors did not make much sense because Harcourt has
  announced a recapitalization plan to ward off a takeover
  attempt by British publisher Robert Maxwell.""It's completely
  inconsistent with the recapitalization, the only way is if they
  drop the recapitalization,"" he said.
      Calls to Harcourt seeking comment were not returned.
      Harcourt's recapitalization will come under scrutiny of a
  U.S. Court in Orlando, Fla. Monday. The company has sought a
  declaratory judgment on convertibility of debentures due 2011
  in light of the recapitalization.
      Harcourt said in a statement this week that Salomon
  Brothers Inc &lt;SB> and Mutual Shares Corp have intervened in the
  case, claiming ownership of more than 30 mln dlrs face amount
  of the debenture. In addition, British Printing and
  Communications Corp, headed by Maxwell, owns 9.5 mln dlrs face
  amount, Harcourt said.
      Salomon said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
  Commission today that it has 21,978 of the debentures. If the
  court decides they should be converted at par value of one dlr,
  they could be converted into 22.0 mln shares.
      Harcourt is asking the court to rule the company is not
  required to issue common to debenture holders who did not
  convert prior to June eight.
      An increase in Reed shares in London today was attributed
  by brokers to rumors of Harcourt's interest and also to rumors

  The U.K. High Court dismissed an appeal

  future cost of abandoning an oil field are not tax deductible,
  the Press Association reported.
      The company was appealing against a decision of the Tax
  Commissioners that any such provision was a capital
  expenditure, not a revenue expenditure, and was not deductible.
  The court was told that since 1976 the company had made an
  annual provision of around 750,000 stg for the eventual cost of
  abandoning a rig.
      An RTZ spokesman said the ruling was not worrying as the
  subsidiary had assumed that the provisions were not deductible

  West German Finance Minister Gerhard
  Stoltenberg said today's meetings of major industrial countries
  would look at ways of strengthening the Paris accord on
  stabilizing foreign exchange rates.
      Stoltenberg told journalists he saw no fundamental weakness
  of the February 22 agreement of the Group of Five countries and
  Canada to keep exchange rates near the then-current levels.
      But he declined to say what measures would be discussed
  ahead of a communique of the Group of Seven ministers later
  today.
      Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said
  the importance of the Paris agreement, also known as the Louvre
  accord, had been underestimated.
      Stoltenberg said there is greater agreement now among major
  countries than six months ago, at the time of the annual
  meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank,
  marked by sharp discord between the United States and its major
  trading partners.
      ""There is no fundamental weakness of the Paris accord,"" he
  said. ""We will be looking at ways of strengthening it, but I do
  not want to discuss that here.
      Stoltenberg said the Louvre agreement was working despite a
  ""slight firming"" of the yen against the dollar.
      And Poehl noted that the dollar/mark parity was unchanged
  since February 22 without the Bundesbank having had to sell
  marks to support the dollar.
      ""The Louvre agreement has been honored by the market,"" he
  said.
      Poehl said West Germany had lived up to its side of the
  bargain in Paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to be
  accelerated as a way of stimulating growth.
      Poehl said, however, that Japan had not yet fulfilled its
  pledges for economic stimulation.
      ""And we will have to see if the United States is able to do
  what they promised in Paris on reducing the budget deficit --
  and get it through Congress,"" he added.
      Stoltenberg reiterated West German concern about a further
  fall in the dollar, noting that the mark was up 85 pct against
  the dollar and nearly 20 pct on a trade-weighted basis.
      ""You cannot expect that to go unnoticed in an economy. And
  it is not just a German problem, it is a European problem,"" he

  Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said

      Asked by the newspaper Bild am Sonntag if lower interest
  rates could boost the domestic economy, Poehl said: ""We would be
  badly advised if we forced further interest rate cuts.
      ""This could, under certain circumstances, release new
  inflationary fears which would then be more likely to lead to
  higher interest rates,"" he added.

  six months because of the mark's surge and the cold winter.
      ""But since April, statistics clearly show that the economy
  finds itself on a course of growth,"" he said. ""I expect this
  development to continue in the coming months.""
      Asked about his expectations of a U.S.-European Community

  Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd
  &lt;JARD.HK> said it will withdraw the previously announced

      A statement said the firm expects to pay total dividends
  for 1987 of not less than 40 cents a share on the expanded
  capital.
      Jardine Matheson decided to withdraw its issue because of a
  joint announcement earlier today by Ronald Li, chairman of the

  Astin, that the listings of new ""B"" shares would be barred.
      The official announcement said this will include the

  saying: ""We continue to believe that the issuing of ""B"" shares
  would benefit shareholders, and regret that they will not be
  given the opportunity to vote on the matter at this stage.""
      Keswick said the ""B"" share issue will benefit Jardine
  Matheson's shareholders by giving the firm flexibility to issue
  ordinary shares for expansion in future without diluting

  share bid made last Wednesday by Union Pacific Corp (UNP), 
  analysts said.
      ""The offer is inadequate,"" said Douglas Augenthaler, an
  analyst with E.F. Hutton, noting that it does not represent the
  needed premium over the company's fundamental value based on
  earnings estimates.
      USPCI, which has 8.7 mln shares outstanding, was trading at
  48-1/8, down 3/8.
      USPCI vice president of finance Larry Shelton said he could
  not comment on the adequacy of the offer or on when the board
  would meet to consider it.
      Augenthaler said that while USPCI was trading at only 34
  dlrs a share at the time of the takeover bid, its announcement
  that same day of higher earnings expectations changed its
  value. USPCI said its second quarter earnings would exceed
  analysts expectations of 24 to 30 cts a share.
      At that price, USPCI could maintain a stock price in the
  low 40s, Augenthaler said.
      Hutton revised its 1987 earnings estimate for the waste
  management concern to 1.40 dlrs a share from 1.20 dlrs on the
  announcment, he said. It lifted its 1988 projection to 1.90
  dlrs a share from 1.70 dlrs.
      In addition, analysts said the hazardous waste management
  business holds significant growth potential. The industry has
  grown from 16 to 35 pct over the last five years, based on
  earnings per share, said Jeffrey Klein, an analyst with Kidder
  Peabody and Co. The industry is expected to continue growing at
  15 to 35 pct over the next five years, he said.
      Augenthaler said the 43-dlr-a-share offer, or 375 mln dlrs
  total, would be a bargain for Union Pacific. The transportation
  and energy company would both gain entry into a profitable
  business and win cost-control benefits, he said.
      ""Union Pacific has what are rumored to be some fairly
  signficant environmmental problems of its own,"" he said.
      Herb Mee Jr., president of Beard Oil Co (BEC), which holds
  a 30.4 pct stake in USPCI, said last week Union Pacific's offer
  was ""grossly inadequate.""

      ""There are no bases of truth to the contents of the Iranian
  accusation on the nature of the operations of the vessels
  recently taken into custody by Iran. These vessels were out
  fishing,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
      It said Iranian Charge d'Affaires Mohammad Baqeri was
  summoned by the Ministry yesterday to confer with Foreign
  Undersecretary Suleiman Majed al-Shaheen.
      The Iranian News Agency IRNA said on Sunday Iran had seized
  seven Kuwaiti speed boats and detained their crew, who
  confessed to spying for Iraq under the cover of fishing.
      It said the boats were intercepted in the Khur Abdullah
  waterway which separates Kuwait and Iraq's Faw peninsula at the
  head of the Gulf, captured by Iran last year.
      The Kuwaiti response came as Iranian envoys toured Gulf

"['corn', 'grain']","SENATOR DEFENDS U.S. MANDATORY FARM CONTROL BILL
  Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, defended his
  controversial mandatory supply control farm bill and said U.S.
  farmers should be allowed to vote in a referendum whether they
  approve of the proposal.
      The Harkin proposal would set loan rates of 5.17 dlrs per
  bushel for wheat, 3.77 dlrs for corn and 9.32 dlrs for
  soybeans, all to be put in effect under strict controls on
  planted acreage reductions. Present loan rates are 2.28 dlrs
  for wheat, 1.92 for corn, and effectively 4.56 for soybeans.
      Also under the plan, the U.S. would seek a world market
  sharing cartel with the European Community and other exporting
  nations, to share-out export markets, Harkin said during the
  first of several Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearings
  examining farm programs.
      Harkin made the following claims in testimony on his
  ""Family Farm Act.""
      -- The mandatory control bill would increase farm income
  and reduce government spending on agriculture.
      -- Harkin said his policy of high price supports would not
  ruin U.S. agricultural exports as critics claim, but would
  increase overall revenue from exports.
      This would be done by seeking agreement among major
  exporting countries including the European Community on market
  sharing at agreed high prices.
      Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., countered during the hearing
  that such a grain export cartel is not workable.
      -- Harkin acknowledged that higher commodity price supports
  would be passed onto consumers, but he said high food prices
  stem more from ""gouging"" by food processing companies than from
  high farm product prices.
      Harkin cited what he termed ""excessive"" net returns on
  equity over five years of 33.4 pct at Kellogg, 31.9 pct
  Monfort, 22.8 pct Nabisco, 22.8 pct ConAgra, 21.2 pct H.J.
  Heinz, 19.1 pct Ralston Purina, 17.2 pct Pillsbury and 16.7 pct
  Quaker Oats.
      -- Harkin said a ""legitimate"" concern about his bill would
  be the impact of higher prices on livestock producers.
      He said as a transition to the higher prices, he would
  allow livestock producers to purchase Commodity Credit Corp.
  grain stocks for three years.
      Thereafter, livestock farmers would benefit from a
  ""predictable and stable"" grain price, he said.
      -- Harkin said that under his policy approach farm
  participation would be no more ""mandatory"" than the current
  farm program. He said farmers now must participate in farm
  programs in order to receive credit for planting and to protect
  farm income.

  Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)
  has drawn up a detailed plan calling for large tax cuts and an
  increase in government purchases of foreign goods, the head of
  the committee working out the plan, Junichiro Koizumi, said.
      The plan will also urge the government to double 1985's
  official development assistance to 7.6 billion dlrs within five
  years instead of seven as the government had promised, senior
  LDP officials said at a press conference.
      LDP executive council chairman Shintaro Abe will explain
  the plan to U.S. Officials when he visits the U.S. On April 19.
      Abe's visit is to prepare for Prime Minister Yasuhiro
  Nakasone's talks with President Ronald Reagan later this month.
      Koizumi said the LDP plan will not specify the size of the
  tax cut or the amount of domestic demand to be stimulated.
  However, top LDP executives will work out figures so that Abe
  will be able to offer specifics to U.S. Officials.
      The proposed increase in procurement of foreign goods by
  the government will probably include the purchase of super
  computers, LDP officials said.
      According to the plan, Japan will also strive to solve
  specific trade problems with other nations and will encourage
  flows of funds to developing countries, the officials said.
      The LDP expects the measures to prop up the economy and
  lessen trade problems with the U.S., They added.
      The basic ideas of the LDP's plan were presented to and
  welcomed by monetary authorities of the major industrial
  nations in Washington last week, they said.
      The LDP plan will form the basis for the last of several
  packages to stimulate Japanese domestic demand and will be

      Senators voted 92-1 for a non-binding measure that endorsed

  Finance Minister Michael Wilson said tax
  reform will not affect his determination to reign in
  expenditures, but his forecasts show a slowing of the decline
  in the budget deficit in the late 1980s.
      ""Responsible tax reform must be fiscally responsible,""
  Wilson said in a speech prepared for the House of Commons.
      Wilson estimated the deficit will fall to 29.3 billion dlrs
  in the year ending March 31, 1988, the same level as he
  forecast in the February budget.
      And in the year ended this past March, the deficit was
  expected to have been one billion dlrs lower than the 32
  billion dlr shortfall originally forecast, Wilson said.
      Wilson said in the current 1988 fiscal year
  higher-than-anticipated spending, particularly in farm income
  support programs, will be offset by higher-than-anticipated
  revenues.
      But finance department documents show the pace of deficit
  reduction was expected to slow temporarily in fiscal 1989 and
  1990 as a result of lower oil and grain prices and the
  transition to the reformed taxation system.
      The deficit is expected to total 28.9 billion dlrs in
  fiscal 1989 and 28.6 billion dlrs in 1989 and then fall to 26.1
  billion dlrs in 1991.
      Wilson was optimistic about the outlook for the Canadian
  economy, forcasting gross domestic product would expand 2.8 pct
  this year and 3.0 pct in 1988. In 1986 the economy grew by an
  actual 3.1 pct.

  The U.S. International Trade
  Commission, ITC, voted to authorize the Commerce Department to
  impose anti-dumping duties on imports of Brazilian frozen
  concentrated orange juice.
      The ITC voted 3-2 in favor of the anti-dumping petition in
  its final ruling on the matter.
      Today's ITC ruling was consistent with the Commerce
  Department's final ruling of March 9, and activates an
  anti-dumping duty of 1.96 pct on imports of Brazilian frozen
  concentrated orange juice, Stephen Vastagh, ITC investigator
  said.
      The ITC found that Brazilian orange juice imports have
  injured U.S. producers. The Commerce Department had already
  ruled that the imports were unfairly priced, and lowered to
  1.96 pct the anti-dumping margin that in a preliminary decision
  last fall had been set at 8.5 pct, Vastagh said.
      The U.S. government has been requiring bond to be posted on
  imports of Brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice since
  Commerce's preliminary ruling of last October 23, he said.
      Commerce had ruled that one major Brazilian producer --
  Cutrale -- would be excluded from the anti-dumping duty.
      Brazilian imports account for about 40 pct of total U.S.
  supply, Vastagh said. Between December 1985 and November 1986,
  the United States imported the equivalent of 546 mln gallons of
  Brazilian orange juice worth 622 mln dlrs, he said.
      Currently, the United States requires a 35-cent per gallon
  tariff on orange juice imports, Vastagh said.
      An ITC spokesman said the agency would forward its final
  report on the anti-dumping case to Commerce by April 22.
      Commerce then will process the anti-dumping order and
  transmit it to U.S Customs, which will liquidate bond entries
  dating from Commerce's preliminary ruling and begin assessing
  duties, Vastagh said.
      He said about 12 Brazilian orange juice exporters,
  including three major shippers, would be affected by the
  decision.

  which owns about seven pct of HBO's stock, filed preliminary
  proxy materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission
  seeking to nominate an alternative slate of directors at the
  company's April 30 annual meeting.
      Andover had expressed an interest to acquire the company in
  September 1986 but HBO has never received an offer from them,
  it said.
      In addition, HBO said its financial condition is improving
  rapidly as the result of a significant restructuring
  implemented in 1986.
      It expects the company to report net income of about 40 cts
  per share in 1987 and a very significant increase in 1988.
      For the year ended December 1986, the company reported a
  loss of 3.6 mln dlrs, or 16 cts per share.

  Dutch insurer AEGON NV &lt;AEGN.AS>
  reported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mln
  guilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profits
  for 1987.
      Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billion
  guilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said its
  revenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and a
  change in accounting practice. It added that revenues would
  have risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred.
      Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainly
  due to its life insurance business.
      Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rose
  despite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and
  higher personal risks.
      Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damage
  insurances. AEGON did not specify the loss.
      In the United States, revenue in guilders from health and
  life insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a change
  in accounting for U.S. Annuities.
      AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personal
  investment influences that it should be accounted differently
  from the more traditional insurances.
      This change in accounting practice and another change to
  account for profits made on fixed interest investments,
  resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mln
  guilders.
      AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profits
  were slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initial
  costs for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in The
  Hague.
      In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emerged
  in the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initial
  costs for these products have depressed net profits somewhat.
      Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON in
  May 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by these
  costs and made only a small contribution to the group's
  profits.
      AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwill
  for Monumental Corp.
      AEGON's net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December
  1986, against 3.46 billion the year before.

['earn'],"VW SAYS 480 MLN MARKS MAXIMUM FOR CURRENCY LOSSES
  Losses for Volkswagen AG
  &lt;VOWG.F>, VW, linked to an alleged foreign currency fraud will
  not exceed the 480 mln marks provision already made, a VW
  spokesman said.
      The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed it
  would pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on
  1986 business, despite the provision.
      One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currency
  dealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses from
  the currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, but
  the VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an ""upper limit.""
      VW said in a statement following today's supervisory board
  meeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal in
  detail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreign
  currency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditing
  company.
      VW has said computer programs were erased and documents
  were faked in the alleged fraud in which it believes
  transactions intended to protect it against possible foreign
  currency losses were not completed.
      VW's former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger was
  arrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of having
  evaded justice.
      Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985
  profits. VW's group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks and
  parent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommend
  an unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company has
  also set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares,
  which were issued last year. Analysts have described the held
  dividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders.
      VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5
  billion marks, with the result that its total dividend payment
  on 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985,
  since the new capital was in preference shares.
      The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves in
  order to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. At
  the end of 1985, VW had parent company reserves of slightly
  less than three billion marks.

"['income', 'interest', 'jobs', 'reserves']","U.K. DATA DEPRESS RATE CUT OUTLOOK - ANALYSTS
  Today's U.K. Economic data have pushed
  the chances of another base lending rate cut from the current
  nine pct further into the distance, analysts said.
      A record fall in unemployment and good manufacturing
  production data showed that the economy is still strong and
  does not need a fillip from lower rates.
      News that underlying earnings are rising 7.75 pct annually,
  taken together with higher than expected bank lending and money
  supply growth, revived inflation worries and monetarist
  arguments against easier credit, they said.
      ""The timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed back
  all the while. The strength of the economy and broad money
  growth are making it more difficult to see one in the near
  term,"" said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall.
      Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday's
  mortgage rate cuts for new borrowers, which building societies
  said were a sign of the expected near term trend for U.K.
  Rates.
      It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week that
  a post-general election cut was imminent, supported by such
  optimistic economic news as May's record reserves rise which
  mirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterling's
  strength.
      The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasm
  about May's 64,300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemployment
  rate, to 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, was rapidly
  replaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlying
  average earnings in April, dealers said.
      The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lending
  rose 2.7 billion stg in May, above forecast, and that the Bank
  of England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offset
  the impact on domestic money supply of its current
  intervention.
      ""The gilt market reaction was correct,"" said Bill Martin,
  chief U.K. Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew.
      ""That's very important ... It shows the economy in a very
  good state indeed,"" Skeoch said.
      ""There's no reason to get worries about inflationary
  pressures because they're very subdued."" Unit wage cost rises
  were better than expected, just one pct higher in the year to
  April, and it was these costs rather than average earnings
  which were potentially inflationary, he added.
      ""I don't think these average earnings numbers are a major
  problem,"" agreed Chase Manhattan's Marshall.
      But he said the gilts market was likely to remain worried
  about the funding implications of recent intervention.
      He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assets
  earlier this year, attracted by growth prospects and hopes that
  the ruling Conservatives would win last week's election, now
  looks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities try
  to prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system.
      However, David Owen, U.K. Economist at Kleinwort Grieveson
  Securities, said any fresh sterling strength would still
  trigger a base rate cut and that today's figures did not signal
  higher inflation this year.
      ""Wage increases are being offset by productivity growth. As
  long as that continues we're okay,"" he added.

  The two sides in the Rotterdam port

      Lammers, Queen's Commissioner for the province of

  agenda and procedures for meetings between the employers and
  unions on a work-practice agreement and proposed redundancies.
      Two months of strikes in the sector began on January 19 in
  protest at employers' proposals for 350 redundancies from the
  4,000-strong workforce this year.
      The strikes were called off by the main port union FNV on

  against the redundancies on procedural grounds.
      The court is due to make a final ruling on May 7 but

"['bop', 'gnp', 'jobs']","HIGHER SPENDING EXPECTED IN MALAYSIA'S 1988 BUDGET
  Malaysia's recovery from the worst
  recession in 20 years should receive a boost on Friday when the
  government announces a reflationary budget for calendar 1988
  after seven years of austerity, economists said.
      ""Our country is walking on one leg now,"" said Ismail Salleh,
  an economist with the Institute of Strategic and International
  Studies. ""It has to depend on public sector investment for
  faster growth if the private sector is not moving.""
      Gross domestic product grew one pct in 1986 after shrinking
  one pct in 1985. The fiscal year ends December 31.
      The government has said it expects 1987 growth to be under
  two pct but some analysts believe it will be nearer three pct
  because prices for commodity exports have risen sharply.
  Malaysia is a leading exporter of rubber, palm oil, tin and
  semiconductors and a major producer of cocoa, timber and oil.
      The government slashed development spending to 9.8 billion
  ringgit this year from 14.5 billion in 1986.
      Economists said unemployment is expected to exceed 10 pct
  in 1988 against about 9.5 pct this year.
      Local investment also has stagnated, with businessmen
  blaming inconsistent economic policies and lack of incentives.
      One businessman said too many politicians give the
  impression that Malaysia was unstable.
      ""If we can take care of investment confidence, the potential
  to recover strongly is great,"" a banker said.
      Malaysia's 1987 current account is expected to be in the
  black with the Central Bank projecting a 500 mln ringgit
  surplus compared with last year's 1.2 billion ringgit deficit.
      The government has said its fiscal policies will balance
  the budget by 1989. The deficit in 1986 was 952 mln ringgit.
      The government will also repay some of its external debt,
  which stood at 51 billion ringgit at the end of 1986.
      Political leaders have said the budget will not hurt
  ordinary people as taxes on basic food and other essential
  goods are unlikely to change.
      Businessmen said they hope the government also will cut the
  corporate tax, now between 45 and 48 pct, to enable Malaysia to
  compete for investors with neighbouring states.

"['interest', 'money-supply', 'trade']","SPANISH EMPLOYERS WORRIED BY HIGH INTEREST RATES
  The head of Spain's employers'
  federation, Jose Maria Cuevas, said employers were worried
  about the government's monetary policies because high real
  interest rates were hampering investment.
      He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far this
  year were not endangering the government's five pct inflation
  target. The government's perceived need to control inflation by
  keeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.
      High real interest rates were attracting an influx of
  speculative foreign capital which was undercutting the
  government's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.
      Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply,
  liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17
  pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and a
  target range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.
      To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call money
  rate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from
  11.8 at end-1986.
      Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call to
  hold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year,
  with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new
  wage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.
      These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish
  workers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.
      He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected the
  state sector, where the government is trying to impose its five
  pct wage ceiling.
      Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in
  Spain's foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the first
  two months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pct
  increase over the corresponding period last year.
      However, employers did not favour a devaluation of the
  peseta to correct the imbalance.

  participation in the 1985 test of the emergency oil sharing
  program of the International Energy Agency.
      The IEA, an alliance of 21 oil consuming countries, was

"['cotton', 'gold', 'grain', 'livestock', 'money-fx', 'silver']","U.S. DOLLAR LOSSES PROPEL BROAD COMMODITY GAINS
  Commodities from gold to grains to
  cotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as losses
  in the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears of
  inflation and economic instability.
      Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in New
  York, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs a
  troy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.
      A key factor behind the advance was anticipation that
  inflation will be the only way for the major industrial nations
  to halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said Steve
  Chronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney,
  Harris Upham and Co., in New York.
      The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials from
  the seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed their
  commitment to support its value, and despite reports of
  intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said.
      Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, known
  as the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-term
  direction of the currency markets.
      ""Maybe they have some ideas or plans,"" said Chronowitz. ""If
  they do, it's not evident.""
      ""It looks like there's no cure but to let the free market
  take values to where they should be.
      ""One way or another, we will force our major trading
  partners to stimulate their economies,"" as a measure to correct
  the mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said.
      ""I think the markets believe, and have believed for a long
  time, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It's
  going to be a long and tedious process, but that's what's
  happening,"" he said.
      The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commodities
  cheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.
      At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bonds
  saw the value of their investments falling and many are turning
  to commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said Marty
  McNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house of
  Dominick and Dominick.
      The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughout
  the commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cotton
  posted broad gains.
      Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in the
  grain markets has shifted from concern about burdensome
  supplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulate
  export demand.
      After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department
  raised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union by
  two mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.
      Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on the
  Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderately
  higher.
      Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They said
  hogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal at
  this time of year, and farmers have been too busy with field
  work to market animals.

  Ecuador will produce crude oil in excess
  of its 221,000-bpd OPEC quota during the second half of this
  year, Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told a news
  conference.
      Ecuador plans to produce 280,000 bpd in August, rising to
  320,000 bpd next January, the minister said.
      ""We will be producing more than the quota to pay off the
  crude and products we have been lent by Venezuela, Nigeria and
  Kuwait and to compensate for the crude we have been unable to
  produce during the past few months,"" he said.
      Earthquake damage to a pipeline sharply cut Ecuadorean

      Santos said the move had been explained to fellow OPEC

  in Ecuador's quota to 221,000 bpd from 210,000 was approved.
      ""They understood our position and we believe we remain
  within the spirit of the (quota) agreement,"" he said.
      Immediately before the March quake Ecuadorean production
  was 250,000-260,000 bpd, with 144,000 bpd exported.
      While its production was down, Venezuela, Nigeria and

  The operator of a major U.S. crude oil
  pipeline, shutdown because of flood damage, said it may be
  several days before repairs are made and the system is
  functioning again.
      Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at
  Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, operator of the pipeline through its
  subsidiary Texaco Pipeline Co, said the company hopes repairs
  will begin in about five days and expects it to take several
  more days to complete.
      ""At this point we are lining up what we know we need, to get
  the job done,"" Stevens said, adding that the timing for repairs
  will depend on the damage to the pipeline which is difficult to
  assess because of flooding on the Red River.
      The pipeline was shipping roughly 225,000 barrels of crude
  oil per day, or about 55 pct of its capacity during the 30 days
  preceding its shutdown on Saturday, Stevens said.
      The pipeline was shut down from Cushing, Okla, to Witchita
  Falls, Kan, on Saturday due to an undetermined leak at the Red
  River crossing, near the Oklahoma/Texas border, because of
  severe rains, a spokesman for Texaco said.
      Stevens said it was reasonable to suggest the pipeline
  could operate at full capacity when it reopens in order to make
  up for the shortfull but cautioned they will talk with
  customers to determine their requirements.
      Oil analysts and traders said they were not sure if the 
  shutdown will continue to raise U.S. oil prices.

  India's national foodgrain target has
  been fixed at 160 mln tonnes in 1987/88 (Apr-Mar), unchanged
  from the 1986/87 target, the Agriculture Ministry said in its
  annual report for 1986/87.
      Actual output was estimated at 151 mln tonnes in 1986/87
  due to failure of monsoon rains in 15 out of 35 meterological
  sub-divisions of the country.
      The report gave the targets for various crops with
  estimated harvested crops in 1986/87 in brackets as following,
  in mln tonnes - rice 65 (60), wheat 49 (49), coarse grains
  including sorghum and millets 32 (29) and pulses 14 (13).
      Despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years, it was
  possible to maintain higher foodgrain production, signifying
  growing resilience in agricultural sector, the report said.
      The strategy for increasing irrigation potential along with
  greater use of high yielding seed varieites and improvement in
  fertiliser efficiency is yielding results, it said, adding
  total foodgrain output in 1985/86, 1984/85 and 1983/84
  respectively was 150.5 mln tonnes, 145.5 mln and a record 152.4
  mln.
     India has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnes
  of foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-year
  development plan ending March 31, 1990.
      Taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the
  1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes, the gap
  of 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining three
  years of the plan by increasing grain output annually by more
  than nine mln tonnes. But the target can be achieved only with
  good weather, the report said.
      ""The major thrust programme will, therefore, be better water
  (irrigation) management. Simultaneously, efforts for spread of
  improved technology including timely use of inputs (farm
  materials like fertilisers) in adequate quantities have to be
  vigrously pursued,"" it said.

  Investor Martin T. Sosnoff said he has
  raised his offer for Caesars World Inc shares to 32 dlrs each
  from 28 dlrs and has reduced the number of shares he is seeking
  to 29.1 mln from all those not already owned.
      In a newspaper advertisement, Sosnoff said the bid by his
  MTS Acquisition Corp, withdrawal rights and the proration
  period will now expire June 19 unless extended. The offer had
  been scheduled to expire May 15. In late March, Sosnoff said he
  had received a ""negligible"" number of shares in response to the
  offer, which had been rejected by Caesars as inadequate.
      Sosnoff already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30 mln
  common shares now outstanding, or a 13.3 pct interest on a
  primary basis.
      Last week, Caesars' board approved a recapitalization plan
  as an alternative to the Sosnoff offer under which shareholders
  would receive a special dividend of 25 dlrs per share, subject
  to approval by shareholders at a special meeting to be held in
  June.
      The company planned to borrow 200 mln dlrs and sell 800 mln
  dlrs in debt to finance the payout.
      Sosnoff said in the newspaper advertisement that the
  amended offer is conditioned on receipt of enough shares to
  give him a majority interest on a fully diluted basis and on
  the arrangement of financing, as well as to approvals by New
  Jersey and Nevada gaming authorities.
      He said the tender would be the first step in acquiring all
  of Caesars' shares and if successful would be followed by a
  merger transaction.
      Sosnoff said later in a statement that the 29.1 mln shares
  he is now seeking, together with the 4,217,675 shares he owns,
  would give him a 92.4 pct interest on a fully diluted basis.
      He said he still has received only a ""negligible"" number of
  shares in response to his tender.
      In a letter to Caesars' chairman Henry Gluck included in
  the statement, Sosnoff said Gluck had again refused, on April
  8, to meet with him, even though he had said he was willing to
  increase the price of his offer.
      Sosnoff said the financing for the offer is almost fully in
  place.
      Sosnoff said PaineWebber Group Inc &lt;PWJ> has now delivered
  to him commitments to purchase up to 475 mln dlrs of increasing
  dividend cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of MTS Holding
  Corp, an indirect parent corporation of MTS Acquisition.
      He said Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM>, which leads a
  syndicate that has provided commitments for a 500 mln dlr
  margin facility, believes it will be able to arrange for
  further commitments under the margin facility to advance up to
  an additional 25 mln dlrs that may be needed to permit the
  purchase of shares under the offer.
      Sosnoff said under the merger that would follow his tender,
  each of the 2,750,000 Caesars shares not covered by the offer,
  or 7.6 pct on a fully diluted basis, would be converted into
  Series A preferred stock valued at 32 dlrs per shareby an
  independent investment baking firm.
      He said ""To the extent that fewer than 29,100,000 sdhares
  are purchased in the offer, the stockholders would receive a
  combination of cash and Series A preferred stock having a value
  of 32 dlrs per share of Caesars.""
      Sosnoff said he believes terms of his offer are superior to
  Caesars' recapitalization.
      Sosnoff said he will be meeting this week with gaming
  officials in Nevada in an effort to expedite the investigatory
  process required for regulatory approval, a process that it
  already underway in New Jersey.
      He said his offer has been extended based on the likely
  duration of the regulatory process.
      He said he intends to further extend the offer if the
  approval process is not completed by the expiration date.

['grain'],"U.S./SOVIET GRAIN MEETING UNLIKELY THIS SUMMER
  Prospects appear slim for a summer
  meeting between U.S. and Soviet officials before the two
  countries enter the final year of their bilateral grains
  agreement, Agriculture Department officials said.
      The two sides usually try to meet as each new year of the
  agreeement approaches although the last meeting was delayed up
  to last February. However, any delay this year should not
  endanger the fifth year of the grains agreement that extends
  through September, 1988, USDA officials said.
      ""It will be difficult to pull together the people for the
  meeting during July,"" an aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel
  Amstutz said.
      Since the last meeting was only around four months ago, the
  next talks could still be a ""couple more months,"" he said.
     
      There has been grain industry speculation that the USDA
  will offer Moscow another wheat subsidy during the next
  marketing year. But USDA officials said even if consultations
  were held soon a subsidy offer would probably not be made.
      ""I doubt that there would be any subsidy offer this summer
  or before the next agreement year begins,"" a USDA source said.
      Citing limited subsidy funds and uncertainties about next
  year's crops, he said, ""There are too many variables now. It
  would be uncharacteristic of us to make an offer now.""
      Under the nonbinding pact, Moscow has agreed to purchase a
  minimum of nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain per year. Soviet and
  U.S. officials normally meet in the summer before the start of
  a new agreement year to discuss grain quality, shipping
  logistics and production outlooks.

  Physio Technology Inc said it
  expects to have a third quarter, ended March 31, loss of about
  200,000 dlrs and is in default on its bank loan because of the
  resignation of chairman and chief executive officer.
      The company said the loss followed four quarters of modest
  profits. In the year ago quarter it earned 11,000 dlrs, or one
  cent a share. For the first half of fiscal 1987, it reported a
  profit of 42,000 dlrs, or two cts a share, compared to a year
  earlier loss of 294,000 dlrs, or 17 cts a share.
      It said President Michael R. Hall will assume the duties of
  chief executive officer.
      Physio Technology said the resignation of Chairman James C.
  Lane can constitute non-compliance with its Series A
  convertible subordinated debentures due 1996 and a default
  under its agreement with the Merchants Bank of Kansas City.
      It explained a declaration of non-compliance under the
  debentures would create a a default under the loan agreements
  requiring immediate payment of 1.8 mln dlrs of debentures and
  about 450,000 dlrs outstanding under the bank credit line.
      The company said the debenture holders intend to waive the
  non-compliance, but reserve the right to withdraw the waiver at
  the end of any 30 day period.
      Physio Technology said it is changing its field sales force
  to independent representatives and dealers from employees to
  ""significantly reduce its fixed overhead.""
      Its statement did not indicate how many employees would be
  affected by the move.
      The company said Lane will become an independent dealter
  for the company in certain midwestern states. He will continue

"['dlr', 'money-fx']","EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE
  European currency markets reacted quietly
  to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers
  ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to
  surprise that the markets should have expected so much.
      The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies
  and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which
  reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency
  stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.
      Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining
  broadly entrenched in its current trading range.
      ""The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84
  marks,"" said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank
  AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.
      However, she said the dollar could break out of the range
  with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.
  Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.
      Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd
  in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against
  the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,
  possibly to 140 yen.
      A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects
  a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.
      London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb
  underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative
  sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank
  operators to test the downside.
      Concern that finance ministers and officials still in
  Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of
  currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with
  worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the
  long term, the traders said.
      Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the
  communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's
  downward trend.
      Traders in several centres said the market would look for
  fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to
  defend current ranges, which the communique said were ""broadly
  consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy
  intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.""
      Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said
  ""They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon."" The
  U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.
      However, some dealers said London-based operators would be
  unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long
  Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825
  marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.
      Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said
  the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable
  market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme
  volatility seen in the first few months of this year.
      One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the
  communique made clear the leading nations did not want a
  further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.
      The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to
  1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre
  accord's supposed currency target range.
      A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were
  ready for a period of ""mainly sideways movement.""
      But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique
  contributing to greater stability.
      ""Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big
  boost,"" said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he
  expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks
  in the next three months.
  

"
['trade'],"U.S.-CANADA TIES SEEN WORSE WITHOUT TRADE PACT
  U.S.-Canadian ties could worsen if
  the two nations are unable to reach a free trade pact,
  according to a study published by two nonpartisan public policy
  research groups.
      The Cato Institute of Washington and the Fraser Institute
  of Vancouver said removing the remaining tariffs on cross
  border trade would benefit both countries.
      But Cato chairman William Niskanen added ""the two nations'
  generally harmonious trade relations are probably not
  sustainable without a new agreement.""
      The United States and Canada, whose cross-border trade
  totaled about 125 billion dlrs last year, have been holding
  talks since last June on a pact to end the few trade barriers
  remaining between their two countries.
      The U.S. put a deadline on the talks of October 1, but both
  sides have said an agreement is likely despite tough bargaining
  remained.
      Niskanen said if no pact is reached, bilateral trade ties
  could deteriorate because of Congressional pressure on
  President Reagan to implement trade laws more aggressively, and
  this could hit some Canadian trade practices.
      He noted Canada is seeking foreign investment in its auto
  industry, which could put strains on the considerable bilateral
  free trade in U.S. and Canadian autos and parts.
      Niskanen also said the Canadian government is vulnerable to
  a resurgence of economic nationalism which could restrict U.S.
  exports to Canada.
      A free trade pact, backed by President Reagan and Prime
  Minister Brian Mulroney, would open new markets for Canada and
  enable its industries to achieve economies of scale, which
  would also help it widen exports worldwide, he said.
      It would also increase the gross national products of both
  countries.
      Niskanen said the goal of a pact should be to end all
  tariffs within 10 years, lower subsidies on exports, set rules
  for trade in services and investments, end curbs on government
  procurement and agree ways to resolve trade disputes.

['gnp'],"PAKISTAN SAYS GOOD ECONOMIC GROWTH CONTINUES
  Pakistan says its economy has continued
  its recent outstanding performance during the financial year
  1986/87 ending on June 30 but areas like balance of payments,
  investments and energy were causing concern.
      GDP grew in line with the average growth rate since 1980
  and the inflation rate was the lowest since 1969/70, according
  to a government economic survey.
       The reform of economic regulation had gathered momentum
  and there was an impressive performance in a five point
  government program for rural uplift, education and poverty
  alleviation, said the survey.
      Ministry Economic Adviser Qazi Alimullah told a news
  conference that before recent unseasonal rains and hailstorms
  damaged the wheat crop, GDP growth was calculated at 7.04 pct
  compared to 7.25 pct in 1985/86.He said the figure might now
  slide down a little to around 6.8 or 6.9 pct.
      The survey said monetary expansion was estimated to be nine
  pct to date but might rise to around 12 pct by the year-end.
      Alimullah said exports rose 18 pct to 3.5 billion dlrs from
  2.9 billion dlrs in 1985/86. But the at the same time, home
  remittances by Pakistanis abroad dropped to 2.3 billion dlrs
  from the 1985/86 level of 2.595 billion.
      More exports and an improvement in the balance of payments
  situation will be required to overcome this declining trend in
  home remittances, he said.
      The survey said the trade deficit was expected to fall to
  2.4 billion dlrs from three billion dlrs in 1985/86 because of
  the boost in exports.
      He said national investment continued to be small because
  of a poor rate of savings, about 14 pct of GDP. He said more
  savings were required to maintain or possibly step up the
  present growth rate and to finance the country's seventh
  five-year development plan to be launched in July 1988.

['retail'],"U.S. MARCH RETAIL SALES CUT BY LATE EASTER
  U.S. retailers' lackluster March sales
  were due to a late Easter, according to analysts who expect a
  recovery in April.
      ""Sales look soft because of the Easter shift, but
  underlying business is better than the numbers indicate,"" said
  Bear Stearns analyst Monroe Greenstein.
       Analysts generally average the sales results of March and
  April to account for the variation of Easter's occurance. This
  year, Easter is being observed on April 19, which is three
  weeks later than last year.
      Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said
  sales for March rose an unadjusted 2.5 to 3.0 pct, and a
  seasonally adjusted 5.5 pct to six pct, compared to an adjusted
  5.7 pct last year.
      ""The obvious question is whether these numbers indicate
  that the consumer activity is slowing, but it does not appear
  to be because liquidity and employment are rising,"" said
  analyst Jeff Edelman, analyst of Drexel Lambert and Burnham.
      Overall, analysts said first half sales are coming in
  according to expectations. Sales for all of 1987 are expected
  to rise about 5.5 pct to six pct, up a bit from 1986's rise.
       In March, sales of housewares, furniture and big ticket
  items were stronger than apparel sales, signaling to many
  analysts that apparel sales will be strong in April as the
  holiday nears.
      ""Sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect a
  continuing strength in the housing market,"" said Edward
  Brennan, chairman of Sears Roebuck and Co &lt;S> which reported an
  overall sales gain of 4.2 pct. Brennan said sales of women's
  sportswear were also excellent.
      ""Sears' total apparel sales was up only modestly, but even
  a modest improvement in apparel is a very good accomplishment
  due to the fact that most people will buy apparel in April,""
  said C.J. Lawrence analysts Harry Mortner. 
      J.C. Penney Co Inc &lt;JCP> and Dayton Hudson Corp &lt;DH> were
  among the weaker performers with comparable stores sales
  declining 1.5 pct and 4.9 pct, respectively. Penney's store and
  catalog sales declined 1.3 pct overall and Dayton Hudson's
  overall sales rose 4.8 pct.
      Penney chairman William Howell said, ""Sales continued
  strong for catalog operations and, geographically, ranged from
  very active in the east to weak in the economically depressed
  southwest.""
      ""Penney's been shifting away from leisure time activity
  wear to other apparel lines, which yield higher profit margins,
  but are currently hurting sales,"" said Greenstein of Bear
  Stearns.
      Hudson chairman Kenneth Mackes cited the late Easter for
  the decline. Edelman of Drexel said that ""Hudson had a tougher
  comparison because it had an exceptionally good 1986.""
      Most analysts agreed that promotions are slightly lower
  than last year.
      ""Retailers are not planning for much - inventories are
  being kept lean, markdowns are lower than last year, but sales
  are coming through anyway,"" said CJ Analyst Harry Mortner.

"['carcass', 'livestock']","EC MEAT DIRECTIVE DEADLINE SEEN FLEXIBLE
  U.S. officials said they held out
  little hope the European Community, EC, would withdraw a
  controversial meat inspection requirement, due to go into
  effect April 30 and which U.S. meat producers claim will cut
  off their exports.
      But the officials said they expect the EC to allow U.S.
  plants to continue shipping meat through the end of the year
  provided they submit a plant improvement program with the U.S.
  Agriculture Department.
      The EC's so-called Third Country Meat Directive will
  require foreign meat processing plants to comply fully with EC
  inspection standards beginning April 30.
      The U.S. meat industry has prepared a petition requesting
  the Reagan administration to retaliate against the EC rule.
      At issue are U.S. meat exports to the EC valued at 132 mln
  dlrs in 1985.
      The EC rule would require all U.S. plants to make changes
  in their inspection methods, ranging from veterinary staffing
  to use of wood.
      Last December, the EC determined that only one U.S. cattle,
  one hog and one sheep slaughtering facility could be approved
  without further review. USDA would have to certify that the
  plants had corrected the deficiencies.
      All remaining plants with a history or potential of
  shipping to the EC -- totaling nearly 400 -- would require more
  significant changes in plant constructions or procedures before
  further EC review.
      Robert Hibbert, general counsel for the American Meat
  Institute, said the meat industry expected to submit a formal
  trade retaliation petition by April 30.
      An interagency committee is reviewing the industry's draft
  petition.
      An official at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said
  U.S. officials continued to press the EC to withdraw the rule,
  but that ""the chances of that are not too good at this time.""
      However, there is the ""expectation"" in U.S. government and
  meat industry circles that the EC will continue to allow
  shipments, at least through the end of the calendar year, from
  U.S. plants that submit to USDA a plan on how they will bring
  their operations into conformity with the EC regulation, the
  USTR official said.

"['dlr', 'money-fx']","POEHL WARNS AGAINST FURTHER DOLLAR FALL
  Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl
  said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation
  of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German
  economic growth.
      In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs
  here, Poehl said ""It would be an extremely risky policy to aim
  for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to
  correct the trade deficit.""
      He said the United States could face a vicious circle of
  depreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took that
  route.
      Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet
  U.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy,
  accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and tolerating
  above-target money supply growth.
      He said he would have been happy to have brought forward
  five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to
  the beginning of this year, but he said the government faced
  political constraints getting such measures through the upper
  house of the West German parliament.
      But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could
  accept on exports from a rising mark, he said.
      Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about
  one-third of its gross national product, so a substantial
  erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing
  demand at home.
      ""A further appreciation of the mark could even be an
  obstacle to further growth,"" he said.
      Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply
  growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and
  because external factors, including low oil prices and
  favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.
      But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma
  over monetary policy.
      The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the
  reported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germany
  was affected more than before by exchange rate developments.
      ""For the time being, we will have to focus our policy more
  on the external side, and we can live with a more expansionary
  money supply. But we must be very careful,"" he said.
      He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan's
  trade surpluses, which affected European countries as well as
  the United States.
      Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary
  officials of major industrialized countries, saying the
  importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange
  rates had been underestimated.
      All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the
  right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he
  said.
      ""This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the
  part of our American colleagues,"" he said.
      But he said there was still a danger that the correction of
  the dollar's value could overshoot.

['acq'],"NEW LEADER COMING TO U.S. SEC IN CHALLENGING ERA
  President Reagan's nominee as top
  policeman for the nation's securities markets will inherit an
  agency challenged by an insider trading scandal, wild stock
  price gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the
  globalization of financial markets.
      David Ruder, a 58-year-old Republican law professor at
  Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., was named Thursday
  to be the 23rd chairman of the five-member U.S. Securities and
  Exchange Commission.
      If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he will succeed
  John Shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a record
  six years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands.
      The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as its
  investigators have probed into the most colossal insider
  trading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street.
      The investigation, which is still active, mushroomed in
  recent months as a growing number of well known traders and
  prominent investment banking firms have been charged with
  wrongdoing.
      The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November after
  Ivan Boesky, one of Wall Street's most successful stock
  speculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigators
  and to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegal
  profits after being charged with insider trading.
      But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new
  phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred by
  computer-driven trading strategies that span markets in 
  securities, options and futures. The price gyrations have
  combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented
  volatility to some U.S. securities markets.
      At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by some
  lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate
  takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers
  steadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape.
      And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreign
  exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork
  for an international securities marketplace in which trading
  occurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.
      Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment
  opportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforce
  U.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.
      Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financial
  disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,
  eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted to
  spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency's
  review of hostile corporate takeovers.
      Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Hutton
  investment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective to
  the agency upon being named chairman in 1981.
      In line with the views of other top administration
  officials, he favored marketplace determination of takeover
  battles over new federal regulations.
      The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider
  trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that
  topped the agency's enforcement agenda during the
  administration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.
      Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with
  Ruder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to
  significantly alter the commission's current priorities.
      The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of them
  lawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that
  figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the
  agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff.
      The agency is one of the few in the government that
  actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past
  few years because of fees it charges public companies,
  investment banks and other securities firms it regulates.
      The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency,
  meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the
  president to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing
  for policy differences alone.
      By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the same
  political party, and the agency prepares its own budget request
  each year instead of leaving this to the White House.
      Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its origins
  to the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributed
  in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted
  market manipulations by large investment firms.
      The agency requires public companies and investment
  vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on
  their financial condition and to disclose changes in their
  condition any time they issue new securities.
      It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks to
  register with it and comply with investor protection rules, and
  it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices.
      Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrial
  magnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later to
  become the nation's 35th president.
      Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who served
  from 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in
  1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon's
  first term and was Reagan's director of the Central
  Intelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.

      In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
  Zinn said the demand for the shareholder list was made on June
  26 because he may desire to communicate with other Crazy Eddie
  shareholders ""regarding the affairs"" of the company.
      Zinn and his firm, which disclosed they hold a 5.1 pct
  stake in Crazy Eddie common stock, said they may acquire more
  shares through a negotiated merger or tender offer.
      Entertainment Marketing was informed on June 25 by Shearson
  Lehman Brothers Inc., acting on behalf of Crazy Eddie, that it
  would be provided with ""certain information"" about Crazy Eddie,
  it told the SEC.
      Entertainment Marketing, a Houston-based firm involved in
  electronics wholesaling and televised home shopping sales,
  proposed an eight dlr a share merger acquisition of Crazy Eddie
  on May 29, and modified the proposal on June 9 to include the
  possible participation of Crazy Eddie management.
      Entertainment Marketing told the SEC it expects to meet
  with Crazy Eddie representatives in the near future.
      Entertainment Marketing also disclosed that it retained
  Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc as its financial advisor and
  investment banker.
      In light of a June 17 announcement from Crazy Eddie that
  Chemical Bank would no longer fund a 52 mln dlr credit facility
  with the company, plus further declines in the price of its

  said they may hold their present stake in the company, sell
  some of their shares, or purchase more shares on the open

  CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S> intends to proceed with
  its planned bid for building materials group Monier Ltd
  &lt;MNRA.S> despite the counter-bid from &lt;Equiticorp Tasman Ltd>
  (ETL), CSR executive director Gene Herbert told Reuters.
      ETL said today it would offer 4.15 dlrs each for Monier's
  issued capital of 156.28 mln shares, plus a share alternative.
  This compares with a 3.80 dlr cash element in CSR's proposed
  bid.
      The proposed offer by ETL, controlled by New Zealand
  entrepreneur Allan Hawkins, came after it built up a 14.99 pct
  stake in Monier in a 95 mln dlr share raid in recent days.
  
      Herbert said Britain's Redland Plc &lt;RDLD.L>, which holds
  just under 50 pct of Monier, still supported the CSR bid and
  had told CSR it is not a seller.
      He said Redland wanted to maintain and build on its
  operations in Australia and the U.S., Where Monier has built up
  a strong presence, notably in roofing tile manufacture.
      The CSR offer contains a put and call option agreement with
  Redland. This enables Redland to accept the CSR bid within six
  months of its close or to lift its stake to 50.1 pct in the
  same period and to run Monier as a joint venture with CSR.
      CSR has said that Redland will take up the second option.
  
      ETL has declined to say why it intervened in Monier, beyond
  describing it as a long term investment.
      ETL would bring no synergies to Monier, unlike CSR which is
  a leader in building materials, Herbert said.
      ""We fit better with Monier,"" he said.
      CSR has said that it will concentrate development on its
  core businesses of sugar and building materials after its moves
  into energy several years ago.
      Asked what he thought ETL's bid sought to achieve, Herbert
  said: ""I'm puzzled as to what Hawkins' strategy is. One has to
  wonder if Monier is the main target.""
  
      Herbert said CSR had no plans to raise its bid, and said a
  higher price would be difficult to justify on fundamentals.
      Monier was trading at 2.80 dlrs when CSR launched its
  original bid of 3.50, or 16.8 times earnings, in late April.
      The shares closed at 3.90 dlrs today, down 25 cents on
  yesterday, after ETL withdrew on reaching the top foreign
  shareholding level permitted without Foreign Investment Review
  Board (FIRB) approval. Its bid is subject to FIRB approval.
      Herbert also said that institutions, which are more likely
  to accept a share alternative than cash, would have to judge
  the respective values of ETL and CSR shares.
  
      ETL is the third group to become involved in a possible
  acquisition of Monier this year. Redland held discussions on a
  possible takeover before the CSR bid emerged but the
  negotiations foundered on the price.
      Share analysts said that for this reason, they did not
  think ETL's intervention would flush out a full Redland bid
  although Monier's ultimate fate rests in its hands.
      ""Redland is still in the driving seat,"" said Tim Cohen of
  &lt;Ord Minnett Ltd>, adding that Redland would be happier having
  CSR as a partner in running Monier than ETL.
      Monier's independent directors have recommended ETL's bid.

      Victoria's &lt;Aluvic Ltd>, on behalf of the state government,

  The rate of increase in world palm oil
  use is likely to slow next season despite an expected 800,000
  tonne production rise to 8.13 mln tonnes, Siegfried Mielke,
  editor of the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said.
      He told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days that in
  the next Oct/Sept 1987/88 season, palm oil use will rise to
  8.25 mln tonnes from 7.71 mln, below the five-year average
  increase of 550,000 tonnes.
       Opening stocks at the start of next October are expected
  to be about 1.4 mln tonnes, 300,000 tonnes below year-earlier
  levels, bringing total supplies to 9.5 mln tonnes, he said.
      The anticipated total supplies will be about 500,000 tonnes
  above this season's available amount, Mielke said.
      The increase in mature palm tree areas in Malaysia will
  slow down from this year on, but that will be offset by area
  expansion in Indonesia, he said.
      He estimated the combined rise in Malaysian and Indonesian
  mature area at 8.7 pct next year, after 9.5 pct this year, and
  at 6.7 pct in 1989 and 5.0 pct in 1990.
      Malaysia also is shifting plantings to Sabah and Sarawak,
  where the rate of expansion is higher than in the Peninsula,
  but where yields are lower, he said.
       The stocks/usage ratio of seven major oils is also
  expected to decline, Mielke said. The oils are soybean,
  cottonseed, sunflowerseed, coconut, rapeseed, palmkernel and
  palm.
      At the start of October 1986 stocks of these oils were
  unusually high and represented 6.8 weeks of the current
  season's prospective demand, compared with six weeks a year ago
  and with 5.4 weeks in 1984, he said.
      Mielke expects the ratio to fall to 5.9 weeks by the start
  of next October and to the unusually low level of 5.4 weeks by
  the end of next season.
      The stocks/usage ratio for palm oil was 11.4 weeks last
  October and is likely to be 8.7 weeks next October and 7.7 at
  the end of next season, Mielke said.
      World oilseed stocks also are expected to fall in the
  course of the next season, with the biggest reduction seen in
  soybean stocks, which Mielke expects to decline by 5.0 mln
  tonnes or by one fifth.
      Almost all of the decline is expected to occur in the U.S.,
  for which he estimated ending stocks next season at 10.7 mln
  tonnes, or 393 mln bushels, against anticipated ending stocks
  of 15 mln tonnes, or 551 mln bushels, at the end of this

['coconut'],"PHILIPPINES APPLAUDS DEFEAT OF U.S. LABELLING BILL
  The Philippine coconut industry has
  greeted with relief the defeat in the U.S. Senate of a bill
  requiring some edible oils to be labelled as saturated fats.
      The bill, which was defeated by the Senate Agriculture
  Committee on Monday, could have cost about 60 mln dlrs a year
  in lost exports, the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) said.
      ""Naturally, we welcomed the defeat but there is a chance the
  bill will be resurrected and attached as a rider to another
  Senate bill,"" a spokesman for the United Coconut Association of
  the Philippines (UCAP).
      PCA chairman Jose Romero noted the vote was close, with
  eight senators voting for it, 10 against and one abstaining.
      The UCAP spokesman said the American Soybean Association
  (ASA) had spent about 25 mln dlrs lobbying for the bill.
      He said the ASA also had obscured the health issue during
  the debate.
      ""Coconut oil is high in saturated fats, but unlike saturated
  animal fats, they do not enter the blood and lymph systems
  leaving fatty deposits connected to heart disease,"" he said.
      U.S. Soybean and cottonseed producers had argued that
  saturated fats cause heart disease and that the labels would
  discourage consumption by health conscious consumers in favour
  of domestic unsaturated alternatives.
      Opponents of the bill said the proposal discriminated
  against imports and would damage the Philippines, Malaysia and
  Indonesia.
      The Philippines earned 488 mln dlrs from coconut products
  in 1986, up from 477 mln in 1985, UCAP figures show.
      Exports to the United States for edible and non-edible use
  account for about half of that total, PCA's Romero said.

['nat-gas'],"TENNECO &lt;TGT> TO TRANSPORT GAS ON OPEN ACCESS
  Tenneco Inc said Tennessee Gas Pipeline
  Co, its largest interstate natural gas pipeline, will transport
  natural gas under the open access rules of the Federal Energy
  Regulatory Commission, FERC.
      In open access, gas pipelines serve purely as a transport
  company, moving gas from suppliers to customers. Pipelines also
  transport its own gas to customers.
      Earlier this week, Transco Energy Co &lt;T> rejected the FERC
  guidelines, saying it would not offer open access until the
  regulatory body offers a solution to the exposure it faces for
  gas it has bought but could not sell.
      The exposure faced by the industry stems from take or pay
  contracts, under which pipelines bought gas on long-term
  contracts they could not sell. The problem grew severe as
  customers won cheaper sources of gas because of open access.
      Some industry analysts speculated earlier this week that
  Tenneco might follow Transco's lead and close its pipelines to
  open-access because of the take-or-pay issue.
      But Tenneco today said open access ""is one of the steps
  FERC is taking to restructure the gas industry in the U.S. FERC
  is moving the industry through this restructuring now, even
  before all transitional problems are solved.""
      A spokesman said Tenneco faces 1.7 billion dlrs in exposure
  under the take-or-pay contracts, but he had no specific figure
  for Tennessee Gas, which runs 2,000 miles of pipelines from
  Louisiana and Texas up to New England.
      ""We remain convinced that the most critical transitional
  issue facing the industry--take-or-pay--must be resolved by
  FERC in the near future.
      ""A failure to do so could have grave consequences for the
  industry's continued ability to provide its customers with
  reliable natural gas,"" said Tennessee Gas Transmission Co
  president R.C. Thomas.

['cocoa'],"COCOA ORIGINS DISMAYED BY BUFFER STOCK ACTION
  Traders recently returned from West Africa
  say some producers there are dismayed by the ineffective action
  so far by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer
  stock manager on buffer stock purchases.
      One trader said some West African producers are annoyed the
  Buffer Stock manager is not playing his part as required by the
  International Cocoa Pact to stabilise prices from current lows.
      So far, only 21,000 tonnes of second hand cocoa have been
  taken up for buffer stock purposes and this, traders noted,
  only on an intermittent basis.
      They noted the purchases, of 8,000 tonnes in the first week
  he bought and 13,000 in the second, are well short of the
  limitations of no more than 5,000 tonnes in one day and 20,000
  in one week which the cocoa agreement places on him.
      The traders recently returned from West Africa say
  producers there are unhappy about the impact on cocoa prices so
  far, noting producing countries are part of the international
  cocoa pact and deserve the same treatment as consumers.
      London traders say terminal market prices would have to
  gain around 300 stg a tonne to take the ICCO 10-day average
  indicator to its 1,935 sdr per tonne midway point (or reference
  price).
      However, little progress has been made in that direction,
  and the 10-day average is still well below the 1,600 sdr lower
  intervention level at 1,562.87 from 1,569.46 previously.
      The buffer stock manager may announce today he will be
  making purchases tomorrow, although under the rules of the
  agreement such action is not automatic, traders said.
      Complaints about the inaction of the buffer stock manager
  are not confined to West African producers, they observed.
      A Reuter report from Rotterdam quoted industry sources
  there saying Dutch cocoa processors also are unhappy with the
  intermittent buffer stock buying activities.
      In London, traders expressed surprise that no more than
  21,000 tonnes cocoa has been bought so far against total
  potential purchases under the new agreement of 150,000 tonnes.
  Carryover holdings from the previous International Cocoa
  Agreement in the stock total 100,000 tonnes.
      Terminal prices today rose by up to 10 stg a tonne from
  Friday's close, basis July at its high of 1,271.
      It seems that when the buffer stock manager is absent from
  the market, prices go up, while when he declares his intention
  to buy, quite often the reverse applies, traders said.

['sugar'],"UK SUGAR FACTORY CLOSES DUE TO SHORTAGE OF BEET
  British Sugar Plc was forced to shut its
  Ipswich sugar factory on Sunday afternoon due to an acute
  shortage of beet supplies, a spokesman said, responding to a
  Reuter inquiry
      Beet supplies have dried up at Ipswich due to a combination
  of very wet weather, which has prevented most farmers in the
  factory's catchment area from harvesting, and last week's
  hurricane which blocked roads.
      The Ipswich factory will remain closed until roads are
  cleared and supplies of beet build up again.
      This is the first time in many years that a factory has
  been closed in mid-campaign, the spokesman added.
      Other factories are continuing to process beet normally,
  but harvesting remains very difficult in most areas.
      Ipswich is one of 13 sugar factories operated by British
  Sugar. It processes in excess of 500,000 tonnes of beet a year
  out of an annual beet crop of around eight mln tonnes.
      Despite the closure of Ipswich and the severe harvesting
  problems in other factory areas, British Sugar is maintaining
  its estimate of sugar production this campaign at around 1.2
  mln tonnes, white value, against 1.34 mln last year, the
  spokesman said.
      British Sugar processes all sugar beet grown in the U.K.
      The sugar beet processing campaign, which began last month,
  is expected to run until the end of January. Sugar factories
  normally work 24 hours a day, seven days a week during the
  campaign.
      As of October 11, 12 pct of the U.K. Sugar crop had been
  harvested, little different to the same stage last year when 13
  pct had been lifted. Since then, however, very wet weather has
  severely restricted beet lifting.
      Harvesting figures for the week to October 18 are not yet
  available.

['acq'],"BORG-WARNER AGREES TO BUYOUT BY MERRILL LYNCH FIRM
  Borg-Warner &lt;BOR> Corp, facing an
  unwanted offer from GAF Corp &lt;GAF>, agreed to a 4.23 billion
  dlr buyout offer from a company to be formed by &lt;Merrill Lynch
  Capital Partners Inc>.
      Borg-Warner and Merrill said yesterday they entered a
  definitive merger agreement, under which a subsidiary of the
  new company, &lt;AV Holdings Corp>, will begin a 48.50 dlr per
  share cash tender offer today for 77.6 mln shares or 89 pct of
  Borg-Warner common stock.
      The offer will be followed by a merger in which each
  remaining share will be converted into 19.75 dlrs cash and
  54.25 dlrs principal amount of AV Holdings junior subordinated
  discount debentures.
      As a result of the merger, Borg-Warner will become a wholly
  owned subsidiary of AV Holdings. A Borg-Warner spokeswoman said
  members of management do not plan to participate in the
  transaction, but they will retain their positions with the
  company.
      A spokesman for GAF was unavailable for comment. GAF holds
  19.9 pct of Borg-Warner's shares.
      GAF had said it would offer 46 dlrs per share.
      Borg-Warner's spokeswoman said the company still plans to
  sell its financial services unit, which includes Wells Fargo
  security guards, and the Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.
      Borg-Warner has been the focus of takeover speculation for
  about a year. Corporate raider Irwin Jacobs last year proposed
  a takeover of the firm and until recently held 10 pct of the
  stock. Following the GAF offer, analysts had calculated breakup
  values for the company in the low 50 dlrs per share range and
  speculated an offer would have to be sweetened.
      In its statement, Borg-Warner said its board endorsed the
  Merrill offer and it recommended that shareholders tender their
  shares. The board received opinions on the offer from its
  advisors, First Boston Corp and Goldman, Sachs and Co.
      James Burke, president of Merrill Lynch Capital Partners,
  said, ""We are very pleased to have entered into this transaction
  with Borg-Warner. We are looking forward to working with the
  employees of Borg-Warner and to Borg-Warner maintaining its
  strong presence in the Chicago community.""
      Merrill Lynch will be the dealer-manager for the offer,
  which expires at midnight EDT May 8 (0400 GMT, May 9), subject
  to conditions, including the completion of necessary financing
  arrangements.
      The offer is also subject to a minimum 44.25 mln shares, or
  51 pct of the outstanding shares, being tendered.
      Merrill Lynch and certain affiliates have committed to
  provide 200 mln dlrs in AV Holdings equity and 870 mln in
  subordinated financing and forward underwriting commitments.
      Merrill Lynch said that following discussions with
  commercial banks it is confident it can obtain the rest of the
  financing required to complete the transaction.
      The junior subordinated discount debentures to be issued in
  the merger will carry a 13 pct coupon and will begin paying
  cash interest after five years.
      The debentures will be redeemable at the company's option
  for the first six years at 105 pct, during the seventh year at
  102.5 pct and after that at 100 pct of the principal amount.
      The junior subordinated discount debentures have a maturity
  of 20 years and are entitled to a sinking fund commencing in
  the 16th year designed to retire 60 pct of the issue before
  maturity.
      Borg-Warner will also redeem all of its outstanding 4.50
  dlrs cumulative preferred stock, series A, for 100 dlrs per
  share. Holders who wish to participate in the offer must first
  convert their preferred stock into Borg-Warner common stock.
      The board of Borg-Warner has also taken steps to redeem its
  poison pill or share purchase rights for five cents per right,
  effective immediately.

  The United States' dependency on

  according to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry
  Research Associates.
      Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conference
  here, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much
  as 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous high
  level of 47 pct in 1977.
      ""The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is
  inevitable,"" Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil
  imports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said.
      Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for
  33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to
  40 pct by 1990.
      ""However, the rate of this growth can be affected
  positively or negatively through government action or
  inaction,"" Lichtblau said.
      He said that one of the government's negative actions is
  the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a
  disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash
  flow for oil exploration.
      Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor
  price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.
      ""An international floor price adopted by all or most
  industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective
  measure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if
  we imposed it alone,"" Lichtblau said.
      Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic
  fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen
  U.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said.
      A potential for alternative supplies could limit the
  willingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said.
      Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer
  tax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the Strategic
  Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans

      President Suharto, in an opening speech to the Indonesian
  Petroleum Association, said Indonesia was ready to extend
  contracts held by foreign oil companies on producing areas.
      ""In order to boost investment in the petroleum industry, the
  government of Indonesia has basically approved of extending
  production sharing contracts under the present laws,"" Suharto
  said.
      ""Apart from that, the government will keep improving the
  investment climate in order to accelerate the development of
  the petroleum industry,"" he said.
      Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto told the Association he
  was aware that the oil industry needed to be assured that
  contracts on blocks expiring within the next 10 years would be
  renewed before they would invest in further exploration.
      ""As we all have heard this morning, the President is fully
  aware of this situation,"" Subroto said.
      ""The government has already made the political decision to
  entertain this time problem by inviting the existing producers
  to continue their activities in Indonesia, albeit on a
  selective basis.""
      Indonesia, one of the 13 members of OPEC, must find new oil
  reserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade, oil
  industry sources say.
      Subroto said the government was also working to ease other
  problems, including granting easier terms for remote areas or
  deep water conditions.
      But Subroto said relations with oil companies were two-way
  and that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration now
  that the oil price had recovered.
      President Suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer of
  technology to Indonesian companies, and more help from the oil
  industry for the regions in which companies operated.
      Abdul Rachman Ramly, the President of state oil company
  Pertamina, has said that budgeted exploration and production
  expenditure for all oil companies in Indonesia was forecast to
  fall to 3.1 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 3.4 billion in
  1986.
      Pertamina has 69 production-sharing or joint operation
  contracts with foreign oil companies.
      Subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for field
  operations was a government priority. There had been
  misunderstandings between the government and the oil industry
  in certain areas, such as when a field is designated
  commercial, and a thorough evaluation was being made.
      He said the government wanted to finalise contract
  extensions as soon as practical, and urged the industry in the
  meantime to maintain its exploration drive.
      Subroto said Indonesia needed the companies to maintain
  exploration efforts, even if their contract was due to expire
  within 10 years. ""This need in itself is some sort of guarantee
  that we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement.""
      Eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewal
  between 1991 and 2001, industry sources said.
      Extension of the contracts on the blocks has involved
  detailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted.
      Subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensions
  would be selective, based on how much capital would be
  invested.

  West German economic growth will slow to
  1.5 pct this year from 2.4 pct in 1986 due to weak domestic
  demand and tougher competition from abroad, the Organisation
  for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said in its
  semi-annual review of the world economy.
      This view is less favourable than the West German
  government's forecast of a growth rate of under two pct this
  year, but is in line with forecasts by independent economic
  institutes of growth ranging from 1.5 to two pct.
      The OECD said that the economy should pick up next year,
  with the gross national product rising by two pct in real
  terms.
      The OECD said it assumed the German economy was passing
  through a period of temporary weakness and there would be some
  recovery in business confidence in the near future.
      But it warned that the key to an improvement in the economy
  was higher domestic demand, which is only forecast to rise by
  2.5 pct this year and 2.75 pct in 1988, below 1986's 3.7 pct.
      While noting that the government is bringing forward a five
  billion mark tax reform to January 1988, the OECD said that ""the
  medium to longer-term performance of the West German economy
  could be improved by reduction of subsidies - which would allow
  relatively lower tax rates.""
      Since the OECD report was compiled, the West German Federal
  Statistics Office has released figures showing that the GNP
  actually fell 0.5 pct in real terms in the first quarter of

  Indonesia has increased its share in a
  434-billion-yen aluminium smelter joint venture with Japan from
  25 to 37 pct, Asahan Project Authority director A.R. Suhud
  said.
      The Japanese Export-Import Bank said Indonesia had raised
  its share of (P.T. Indonesia Asahan Aluminium) company,
  capitalised in 1975 at 91 billion, by swapping 32 billion yen
  in government loans to the company for an equity stake.
      The Japanese shareholders, the Overseas Economic
  Cooperation Fund and 12 companies, are to invest another 24
  billion yen raising capitalisation to 147 billion yen.
      Asahan reported total losses of 97.6 billion rupiah between
  1982 and 1985. Suhud said much of the company's 320 billion yen
  debt had been caused by falling tin prices and the appreciation
  of the yen against the U.S. Dollar. Aluminium is sold in
  dollars.
      Prices improved from 1,150 dlrs a tonne six months ago to
  about 1,450 dlrs today. The plant is supposed to break even if
  prices stay at 1,500 dlrs a tonne.
      Sahud said the plant, with a capacity of 220,000 tonnes a
  year, would probably lose money again in 1987. The plant,
  situated in North Sumatra, produces mostly for Japan.

"['crude', 'money-fx']","VENEZUELA LOWERS EXCHANGE RATE FOR OIL EARNINGS
  Venezuela's cabinet approved a new
  exchange rate for oil and mining export earnings, setting it at
  14.50 bolivars to the dollar from 7.50 bolivars previously,
  Minister Manuel Azpur UA said.
      Azpur told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the
  measure is ""fundamental to conserving the economic and financial
  strength of the petroleum industry.""
       He said the new exchange rate, which goes before the
  central bank for final approval tommorrow, will allow the state
  oil company Petroleos De Venezuela, S.A.(PDVSA) to solve its
  problem of working capital and implement investment plans,
  estimated at 20 billion bolivars for 1987. He did not say when
  the measure would become effective.
     Venezuela's oil industry previously sold its dollar earnings
  to the government at 7.50 to the dollar but bought foreign
  exchange from its imports at 14.50 bolivars.
     The new exchange rate will promote purchases of domestic
  goods and services by the industry, Azpur said. He added that
  it would also put PDVSA in a position to purchase more
  government debt bonds.                        
      PDVSA had available liquid assets of 20 billion bolivars at
  the start of this year, of which nine billion were in a trust
  fund in the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) and placed in
  government bonds.
    According to a contract between PDVSA and the central bank,
  the BCV must provide cash as the oil industry requries by
  repurchasing the bonds.

  Irving Bank Corp said a six pct drop

  result of placing medium- and long-term loans to borrowers in
  Brazil and Ecuador on non-accrual status.
      Income in the first three months fell to 28.60 mln dlrs
  from 30.43 mln in the same 1986 period. Earnings per share
  dropped to 1.51 dlrs from 1.62.
      Irving put 215 mln dlrs of Brazilian and 33 mln dlrs of
  Ecuadorean loans on non-accrual, reducing first-quarter net

      Irving estimates full year net would be reduced by 15.3 mln
  dlrs after tax if no cash interest payments are received on
  these loans during the remainder of 1987.
      Also adversely affecting earnings were losses on the
  trading of securities and higher non-interest expenses,
  although these were partly offset by increased trust income,
  profits from foreign exchange trading and investment securities
  gains, the bank said.
      The allowance for loan losses was 224.8 mln dlrs, up from

  Hollinger Inc will pay about 50 mln dlrs
  cash for its previously reported acquisition of privately owned
  Unimedia Inc, chairman Conrad Black told reporters after the
  annual meeting, confirming a published report.
      Commenting on press reports about the 50 mln dlr price tag,
  Black said, ""That would not be wildly inaccurate,"" although he
  declined to disclose the actual cost.
      Montreal-based Unimedia is Quebec's third largest newspaper
  group, with three French language daily newspapers in Quebec
  City, Ottawa and Chicoutimi, Quebec and four printing plants in
  Ontario and Quebec.
      Black added that Hollinger would also continue seeking
  acquisitions of daily newspapers with circulation under 25,000
  readers. He said Hollinger was currently talking to about 10
  such newspapers in the U.S. where the company currently owns 23
  dailies.
      ""There is really no end to the ones that are available,"" he
  told reporters, although he added that most remaining
  acquisition opportunities are in the U.S.
      He said that Hollinger's 58 pct-owned Daily Telegraph PLC,
  of London, should become profitable in this year's fourth
  quarter.
     
      For full-year 1987, the Daily Telegraph could break even or
  better, said Black, citing major reductions in labor costs and
  improved technology at the Telegraph, Britain's largest
  circulation quality daily. The Telegraph lost 13.2 mln Canadian
  dlrs last year.
      Daily Telegraph chief executive Andrew Knight told
  reporters after the meeting that the Telegraph's daily
  circulation had risen by 25,000 since September to about
  1,150,000 on weekdays, despite added competition from the new
  Independent daily newspaper.
     
      Knight said The Independent was not affecting the
  Telegraph's growth, but was making inroads into the circulation
  of other London quality dailies such as The Times and The
  Guardian.
      Hollinger chairman Black predicted Hollinger would post
  1987 net income of about 55 mln dlrs, or one dlr a share,
  including extraordinary gains from previous sales of
  discontinued operations. Hollinger lost 87 mln dlrs or 6.54
  dlrs a share last year on fewer average shares and after an
  extraordinary loss of 52 mln dlrs.
     
      Black told shareholders that first quarter operating
  earnings on continuing operations amounted to 499,000 dlrs
  against a year-ago loss of 165,000 dlrs.
      Revenues on continuing operations rose to 102.1 mln dlrs
  from 1.5 mln dlrs last year, which did not include Daily
  Telegraph revenues, he added. Consolidated first quarter
  figures were not disclosed.
      He said the Daily Telegraph's first quarter operating loss

['trade'],"INVESTMENT CRUCIAL TO U.S. TEXTILE RECOVERY
  With more private investment, not more
  protection, the U.S. textile industry could become competitive
  with the most modern foreign producers, analysts from two
  congressional agencies said today.
      The Office of Technology Assessment, a nonpartisan arm of
  Congress told a House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee hearing
  there was still concern for the future of parts of the U.S.
  textile and apparel industry, but there was more reason for
  optimism than a few years ago.
      ""While textile producers are making significant
  investments, they could do more,"" OTA analyst Henry Kelly said.
      The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisan
  budget analysis arm of Congress, said federal loans or loan
  guarantees would be preferable options for Congress rather than
  increased trade protection which could lead to foreign
  retaliation.
      CBO analyst Edward Gramlich said past trade protections,
  first imposed in the 1950's have had only a small benefit for
  profits and investments of domestic firms.
      Trade Subcommittee chairman, Rep. Sam Gibbons, said the
  agencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion against
  congressional approval of protectionist textile quota
  legislation aimed mainly at Western Europe, Japan and other
  Asian textile producing countries.
      President Reagan last year vetoed a textile protection bill
  but it was reintroduced in this session of Congress and is
  expected to be voted on in the House this year.
      However, approval this year is in doubt because passage of
  a major trade bill without specific protections for textiles
  showed a weakening of support for the legislation.
      Most U.S. producers have fallen behind other foreign
  producers in the use of modern textile and apparel production
  equipment and net imports are growing faster than the domestic
  markets, Kelly said.
      He added that private investment in the textile and
  clothing industry in 1983 of 0.5 pct was less than one-seventh
  the average manufacturing investment of 3.9 pct.
      Despite existing import quotas and tariffs, imports of
  textiles grew 26 pct in 1986 and imports of apparel grew 14 pct
  while U.S. production rose only 1.9 pct.
      ""The traditional industry seems destined to be replaced by
  new technology, imports, or some combination of both. While the
  industry may not be able to compete in all domestic markets
  that it enjoyed twenty years ago, the results of our research
  indicate that portions of the domestic market can be recovered,
  and that exports can be expanded,"" Kelly said.

  Belgium, current holder of the European
  Community presidency, appears ready to drop a controversial
  oils and fats tax from this year's hotly-contested farm price
  package, diplomats said.
      In a discussion document prepared for today's summit
  meeting of EC leaders, Belgium proposed the so-called
  ""stabilising mechanism"" be the subject of ""further study and
  consultation with the Community's main trading partners.""
      The proposal for a tax of as much as 330 Ecus per tonne on
  both imported and domestically-produced vegetable and marine
  oils and fats has attracted a storm of international criticism.
      The discussion document, aimed at preventing a cash row at
  the summit and breaking the deadlock at this year's farm price
  talks, contained the first formal reference to dropping the
  measure.
      Britain and Denmark, which assumes the EC presidency on
  June 30, have led the opposition to the measure. They are
  supported by West Germany and the Netherlands and, to a lesser
  extent, Spain.
      Although the paper was not universally welcomed, diplomats
  said, the proposal to postpone consideration of the tax for a
  further six months was certain to survive any redrafting.

['acq'],"UAL &lt;UAL> MAY RESPOND TO PILOTS TODAY
  UAL Inc may have a response this
  afternoon to the pilots union proposal to buy its United
  Airlines unit, a UAL spokesman said.
      ""Obviously, we have a lot of movement in our stock, and we
  need to get a clarification out,"" the spokesman said, adding
  that there was a ""50-50"" chance a statement would be released
  today.
      The pilots earlier this week offered to buy the airline for
  2.3 billion dlrs, and assume 2.2 billion dlrs of existing debt.
      Takeover speculation has driven UAL's stock for several
  weeks. UAL last month said New York Real estate developer
  Donald Trump held a position in its stock, and that he also
  held discussions with its chairman.
      The developer indicated in those talks that he took the
  position as an investment, but he revealed no other plans.
      Today, rumors circulated that Coniston Partners were buying
  UAL stock. UAL jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2
  mln shares.
      ""United has got to consider this proposal. I think the
  pilot's proposal is realistic. I don't exptect them to take it,
  but it could put some interesting options in front of UAL
  management,"" said Timothy Pettee, Bear Stearns and co analyst.
      Analysts have said UAL made itself vulnerable to attack
  when it diversified away from its core airline. It added Hertz
  rental cars, Westin and Hilton International hotels in a
  strategy to become a travel service company.
      The strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots union
  concerned that the company was not focussing enough attention
  on its airline.
      UAL has stood firm on its strategy. It is emphasizing its
  new focus by changing its name to Allegis, as of May one.
      But takeover speculation has escalated, and Wall Street has
  been busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100
  dlrs per share. Traders today described the buying in UAL as
  widespread, indicative to them that big institutions believe
  the stock is in play.
      Market sources have said that although Trump attracted
  attention to the stock, the pilots proposal acted as a
  catalyst, kicking off a new round of speculation and perhaps
  throwing the company into the hands of another buyer.
      ""The first domino is you have an investor with a
  considerable stake. the second domino is the union. That type
  of attitude has been a precursor to airline deals in the past,""
  said Pettee.
      ""What's interesting is the values are there. There's
  something for everybody,"" he said.

  reportedly hold 7.4 pct of the company's shares, tried to
  induce Multifood's management to join them in an effort to take

      ""This marks our first major expansion in California,
  particularly in the south,"" said Citicorp Savings President
  Edward Valencia, in a statement.
      Thrift industry sources said they do not see a major
  near-term impact on the Southern California thrift market, but
  do expect Citicorp to be a more aggressive competitor than
  Sears was in that market.
      ""We do believe they will be a better competitor than
  Sears,"" said James Stutz, Executive Vice President of Home
  Federal Savings and Loan Association &lt;HFD>, based in San Diego.
      Banking industry sources said the move is viewed as
  groundwork, to establish Citicorp throughout the California
  market, well before the 1991 law change that will allow it to
  operate as a bank in the state. They said Citicorp is likely to
  convert the branches to banks at that time.
      In the near-term, however, analysts said with seven billion
  dlrs in assets, Citicorp Savings is still not a major force in
  the thrift market, against such large California thrifts as
  Home Federal, Great Western Financial Corp &lt;GWF>, H F Ahmanson
  and Co &lt;AHM>, Golden West  Financial &lt;GWD> and Great American
  First Savings Bank &lt;GTA>.

['acq'],"JUDGE TO DECIDE BURLINGTON &lt;BUR> IN SEVERAL DAYS
  U.S. District Court Judge Eugene
  A. Gordon said he will decide ""in the next few days"" whether to
  grant Burlington Industries Inc's request to stop a takeover by
  Samjens Acquisition Corp.
      ""I do not know how I come down on this preliminary
  injunction,"" Gordon said after listening to arguments by
  attorneys for 1-1/2 days.
      ""It's been a long time since I was deluged with as much
  information as I have been. I have to consider what's been
  presented and issue an opinion on this. Both sides cannot be
  winners,"" he said.
      Burlington requested the injunction to stop a takeover
  effort by Samjens, claiming the partnership used illegally
  obtained confidential information about the company to make its
  offer. It also alleges there would be anti-trust violations if
  Samjens, formed by Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of
  Canada, were to succeed.
      Samjens last week topped a 76 dlr per share offer for
  Burlington from Morgan Stanley Group &lt;MS> by one dlr per share.
  Morgan Stanley made its 2.44 billion dlr bid after Samjens bid
  72 dlrs per share for Burlington.
      Burlington lawyers told the court if the injunction is not
  granted Samjens would win control of Burlington. A Samjens
  lawyer argued that if the judge granted the injunction it would
  ""kill the offer""
      Jay Greenfield, an attorney for Samjens, said the
  partnership would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction
  were granted. ""There's only one Burlington,"" he said. ""If we
  cannot get that then no amount of money can compensate us.""
      Greenfield also said Samjens could sell its holdings in
  Burlington for 95 mln dlrs. ""We don't want that. We're not in
  this for the money,"" he said.
      Irving Nathan, a Burlington lawyer, reiterated that
  information provided by James Ammeen, a former Burlington
  executive, was crucial to Dominion's decision to attempt o
  takeover of Burlington.
      ""Dominion relied on the information provided by the insider
  Jim Ammeen,"" Nathan said.
      An attorney for Ammeen, who is named as a defendant, asked
  the court to dismiss the lawsuit against his client. The judge
  said he would not rule on the request today.

  Italy's Foreign Trade Minister Mario

  securities.
      Sarcinelli was reacting to suggestions that last month's

  2,040 billion surplus, could be linked to a May 13 decree
  abolishing obligatory non-interest-bearing deposits on foreign

      Earlier today the newspaper La Repubblica cited remarks by

  it had been partly caused by ""non-banking capital outflows.""

['trade'],"TAIWAN ANNOUNCES NEW ROUND OF IMPORT TARIFF CUTS
  Taiwan announced plans for another round
  of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade
  talks with Washington which officials described as a move to
  help balance trade with the United States.
      Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry's
  Customs Administration Department, told reporters the list of
  products included 60 items asked by Washington.
      ""The move is part of our government efforts to encourage
  imports from our trading partners, particularly from the United
  States,"" he said.
      He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinet
  that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles,
  apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut
  by between five and 50 pct.
      The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday
  and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting
  on April 20, he added.
      Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700
  foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce its
  growing trade surplus with the United States, the island's
  largest trading partner.
      Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and
  pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade
  deficit with Taipei.
      Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6
  billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. It
  widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78
  billion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show.
      Today's announcement came before a departure later today of
  a 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series of
  trade talks with U.S. Officials.
      The delegation's leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters last
  night he was leaving with ""a heavy heart,"" meaning that he would
  face tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionist
  sentiments in the U.S. Congress. Taiwan's 1986 trade surplus
  with Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada.
      Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S.
  Calls for Taiwan to open its market to American products,
  purchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment,
  import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property.
      ""I am afraid this time we have to give more than take from
  our talks with the U.S.,"" he said without elaborating.
  

"
['interest'],"TOKYO STOCK PLUNGE COULD FORCE EASIER MONEY POLICY
  Plunging Tokyo stock prices will prevent
  the Bank of Japan from raising its discount rate and could even
  force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues,
  government and private economists said.
      A rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark
  further selling of shares that could ultimately have a major
  deflationary impact on the real economy, they said.
      Although Bank of Japan officials have consistently
  maintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discount
  rate, many in the markets have thought otherwise. 
      Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the
  central bank's apparent decision last week to countenance
  higher rates on commercial bills, dealers said.
      But today's stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15
  pct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed to
  raise the discount rate now, despite its concerns about a
  renewed outbreak of inflation, dealers and economists said.
      Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the
  markets concluded that the stock market's collapse precluded
  the central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discount
  rate increase.
      A senior government economist suggested that both the U.S.
  And Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a
  further drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices. ""They need to
  support the stock and security markets,"" he said.
      But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to change
  policy for the moment, although one admitted that the central
  bank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock prices
  continue to plunge during the rest of the week.
      Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed the
  economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary
  impact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago.
      With the economy recovering strongly, the steep drop in
  stock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and
  business confidence, one government economist said.
      ""There will be some impact on the real economy, but it won't
  be that big,"" said another.
      Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their
  own, although they do participate through trust funds and other
  investment vehicles. And while many manufacturing firms turned
  to financial market investments for profits during last year's
  economic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them to
  refocus their attention on their core businesses, he said.
      Paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that is
  partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have
  shifted funds away from financial investments to increase
  inventories and step up capital spending, one government
  economist said.
      In deciding what response to make to the steep stock price
  drop, the Bank of Japan must first determine whether prices
  will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a
  greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation,
  one central bank official said. ""That will at least take a
  couple of days, if not weeks,"" he said.

  The European Commission was authorised

"['oilseed', 'soybean', 'trade', 'veg-oil']","ASA SAYS EC OILSEED POLICY ILLEGAL UNDER GATT
  The American Soybean Association (ASA)
  denounced European Community (EC) oilseed policies as illegal
  under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and
  threatened to make an unfair trade complaint if the EC does not
  remedy the situation.
      ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsored
  Outlook 87 conference: ""It will be filed unless the EC takes
  drastic and immediate steps.""
      ""These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal,
  since they were established after the zero soybean duty was
  established in 1962,"" he said.
      The ASA's unfair trade petition against the EC would ask
  for an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies to
  make the regime non-discriminatory.
      The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free, in
  an effort to fill its oilseed needs. But EC oilseeds production
  has risen dramatically since then.
      The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above world
  market levels and is considering implementing a controversial
  oils and fats tax.
      The subsidies ""are obvious attempts to circumvent the zero
  duty binding and that makes U.S. Farmers mad as hell,"" Adams
  said.
      The ASA is confident the U.S. Congress will support its
  trade complaint, Adams said. The ASA also strongly opposes an
  EC proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in the
  EC, which will be considered by the EC Commission in December.
      U.S. Soybean world market share has declined 35 pct in
  volume and 40 pct in value since 1982, primarily as a result of
  EC policies, Adams added.
      Lord Plumb, European Parliament President and a speaker at
  the conference, said the EC expanded oilseed production in 1973
  when the U.S. Halted overseas sales of soy products.

"['interest', 'money-fx']","BUNDESBANK CALLS FOR CENTRAL BANK COOPERATION
  Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler
  called on central banks of major industrialised nations to
  cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies.
      In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-released
  here, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was
  protectionism and control on capital movements.
      ""Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market
  transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have
  them,"" he said. He added that West German growth forecasts would
  have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop
  to 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.
      Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets
  had parted company with transactions in goods, services and
  investments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that
  determined market trends.
      Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to
  grow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates
  would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.
      ""In other words, the monetary policy measures required are
  different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --
  those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of
  mounting economic activity,"" Koehler said.
      The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.
  Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation
  going by talking the dollar down posed problems.
      The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep
  rise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost
  of European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports
  to the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to
  make itself felt compared with the price effect.
      ""Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going
  further than would be necessary to adjust the current account
  over the medium term,"" Koehler said.
      A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur
  only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.
  In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should
  rise faster than GNP.
      ""In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986,"" Koehler said.
      If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be
  prevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by
  an inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..
      But only if there was an appropriate interest rate
  differential would Europe and Japan look for financial
  investment in the U.S.
      When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank
  had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its
  measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.
      Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates
  by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading
  interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market
  and its substantial impact on exchange rates.
      It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of
  price stability, economic growth and full employment but also
  to tackle international problems like the exchange rate
  problem, the debt problem and the current account problem.
      A strategy had to be designed that helped ""the safeguarding
  of non-inflationary economic growth in an international
  monetary system largely free of disruptions,"" Koehler said.
      Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was
  necessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed
  to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over
  the next few years and intervention points should not be set,
  because they were only testing points for the market, he said.
      In order to keep the international monetary system free of
  disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but
  also cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.

['nat-gas'],"BROOKLYN UNION&lt;BU> SEEN HURT BY PIPELINE CLOSURE
  Brooklyn Union Gas Co, a New York gas
  utility, will see its gas costs up sharply as a result of
  Transco Energy Co's &lt;E> decision to close its pipelines to
  transport spot gas sales, energy industry analysts said.
      Brooklyn Union, the fourth largest gas utility in the
  United States, purchased 36 pct of its supplies on the spot, or
  non-contract, market in 1986, and the proportion of spot
  supplies was estimated much higher in the five months of 1987,
  analysts said.
      Texas Eastern pipelines &lt;TET>, the other competing
  pipeline, to deliver spot gas from producing areas in the South
  closed its gate station for summer, and Brooklyn Union has
  relied entirely on Transco for spot supplies.
       In the month of May, Brooklyn Union paid about two dlrs
  per mln British Thermal Unit for spot gas, while contract gas
  costs four to five dlrs per mln BTU, industry sources said.
      Transco announced yesterday it would no longer provide open
  access to transport spot natural gas to its customers for fear
  of accumulating more take-or-pay liabilities.
      Take-or-pay contracts oblige pipelines to pay producers for
  gas even if delivery is not taken by its customers.
      Brooklyn Union will continue receiving a small amount of
  supplies from minor fields under a grandfather clause, a
  Brooklyn Union official said.
      Foster Corwith, gas analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said
  most of the rising cost to Booklyn Union will be passed through
  to rate payers.
      While net effect on the company will not be known for
  several months because of the time lag in deferred earnings,
  end-users, especially residential and commercial customers,
  will end up paying more for gas, he said.
      Because the closure takes place in summer months when gas
  demand is at seasonal low, the impact on cash flow would be
  small, Curt Launer, natural gas analyst with Donaldson Lufkin
  Jenrette, said.
      If the situation persists into winter heating season, high
  cost gas could cut in the company's profits, he said.
      Gas utilities along eastern seaboard relying on Transco for
  spot gas, such as North Carolina Natural Gas Co &lt;NCNG>,
  Piedmont Natural Gas Co &lt;PNY>, will face the same high cost
  factor as Brooklyn Union, Steve Richards, a supply manager with
  end users supply system, a Houston based natural gas brokering
  firm, said.
      ""But these companies are not unwitting victims of the
  take-or-pay dispute between Transco and producers,"" he said.
      Distributors have turned a deaf ear to Transco's request
  for an inventory charge, which reserves the pipeline facility
  for spot gas to be delivered to these companies, he said.
      Without spot supplies, the high cost of system gas will
  threaten to drive away large customers capable of shifting to
  alternative fuels, he said.
      In absence of any guidelines on inventory charges from the
  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the matter is being
  negotiated between pipelines and customers, Richards said.
      Now that Transco has refused to transport cheap spot gas
  for them, these distributors are likely to be more conciliatory
  on the inventory charge, he said.
      ""Cool heads will prevail,"" DLJ's Launer said, "" but it may
  take a while.""

  Italy's economic outlook for 1987 and 1988
  is likely to be less favourable than last year with slightly
  lower growth, higher unemployment and an increased trade
  deficit, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
  Development (OECD) said.
      But the OECD, in its half-yearly report, forecast a
  slightly lower inflation rate over the next two years. Last
  year Italy ranked as one of the OECD's fastest growing
  economies with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at 2.7 pct.
      The OECD said Italy's GDP may grow by three pct in 1987,
  but will then fall back to 2.5 pct in 1988.
      The inflation rate will probably stabilise at around five
  pct during the projection period as a result of a turnaround in
  import prices, particularly oil, an acceleration in labour
  costs and the effects of domestic demand pressure, the report
  said.
      This year, and to a lesser degree in 1988, domestic demand
  should be stimulated by buoyant growth in household consumption
  made possible by wage increases following pay negotiations.
      Domestic demand pressure, coupled with the deterioration in
  Italian competitiveness, is likely to stimulate imports and
  adversely affect exports in 1987 and 1988. This could result in
  a sharp negative contribution to the currrent account.

  Treasury Secretary James Baker said
  the floating exchange rate system has not been as effective as
  had been hoped in promoting stability and preventing imbalances
  from emerging in the global economy.
      In remarks before the afternoon session of the
  International Monetary Fund's Interim Committee, Baker said he
  was not suggesting that the system should be abandoned.
      ""But I do suggest,"" he said, ""that we need something to give
  it more stability and to keep it headed in the right direction
  when the wind shifts.""
      He said that indicators can serve ""as a kind of compass"" but
  added that structural indicators can help focus attention on
  some policies.
      Baker, however, said the IMF ""needs to move beyond
  macroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators that
  can help focus attention on some of the policies of specific
  relevance to the imbalances we face today.""
      The Treasury Secretary said that indicators should be given
  a more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- Article
  IV consultations -- that the Fund performs.
      Baker also told the policy making group that it was time
  for the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMF
  surveillance more relevant to national policymakers and the
  public.
      ""In particular, we urge increased publicity for IMF
  appraisals developed in Article IV consultations, the use of
  follow-up reports on country actions to implement IMF
  recommendations, and greater use of special consultation
  procedures,"" he said.
      Baker emphasized that indicators were a device ""for moving
  beyond rhetoric to action.""
      He said they provide ""more structure to the system, and
  induce more discipline and peer pressure into the process of
  policy coordination.""
      He said the Fund's procedures for surveillance need to be
  reviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators.
      ""This should be matter of priority for the executive board,""
  he said.
      Baker also urged the Fund to develop alternative
  medium-term economic scenarios for countries that ""can help us
  focus even more clearly on the most important imbalances, by
  identifying options for addressing them and analyzing the
  implications of these options.""
      He said also that further work should be done on finding
  paths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives.

  significant deviations from an intended course, then we must
  have more definitive ways of indentifying the right course for

  U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said
  the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by Tokyo last
  week went further than the U.S. Had expected.
      But he said the U.S. Would not lift the selective economic
  sanctions it imposed on Japanese imports in April until Tokyo
  changed its sales policies concerning computer microchips.
      Speaking in a televised news conference linking several
  European capitals, Shultz said it was heartening that the
  Japanese had confronted the problem of stimulating domestic and
  global demand.
  
      ""There is an even greater amount of stimulus than was
  originally thought,"" said Shultz, speaking from Washington.
      ""It is a lot more than nothing. It is more than was talked
  about when (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone was here.
      ""It involves a major reduction in tax rates and we believe
  that getting the tax burden down is one way of stimulating the
  economy,"" he added.
      But asked by Japanese reporters, also linked into the news
  conference, whether the positive reaction meant the U.S. Might
  decide at next week's Venice summit to lift its sanctions on
  some Japanese electronic goods, Shultz replied:
      ""These sanctions were undertaken on the basis of an
  agreement that had been reached between the United States and
  Japan on various sale practices and prices relating to the chip
  market.
      ""They will be lifted as the facts of change by Japan to the
  agreement that it made become evident.""
      He said U.S. Officials had only been able to monitor the
  situation for a month and that it was impossible to determine a
  trend on only one month's data.
      The U.S. Imposed 100 pct import duties on personal
  computers, colour televisions and power tools, alleging that
  Japan had violated last September's bilateral agreement by
  selling computer chips at below fair market value.
      Shultz said West Germany and other nations would also do
  well to look at what they could do to stimulate demand.
      Asked whether the U.S. Could reasonably ask its allies to
  take action to stimulate the world economy without a bold
  American initiative to reduce the size of the federal budget
  deficit, Shultz said moves were already underway to tackle the
  problem.
      He said by the end of the current fiscal year the deficit

  last year, and that the budget being worked on this year would

  European Community agriculture
  ministers will meet tomorrow evening, after the end of a

  to agree a 1987/88 farm price package, an EC Commission
  spokesman said.
      He added that tomorrow's EC Official Journal will contain

      The spokesman declined to detail these special measures but

  Honeywell Inc said a gain of
  20.1 pct in its 1987 first quarter operating earnings was the
  result of cost cutting efforts which began last year.
      Honeywell reported 1987 first quarter operating earnings
  rose to 43.7 mln dlrs or 96 cts a share from 36.4 mln dlrs or
  79 cts in the same period a year ago.
      Better operating results in each of the company's three 
  sectors offset higher interest costs in the first quarter due
  to financing the December acquisition of Sperry Aerospace and
  the sharing of the Federal Systems subsidiary pre-tax profit
  with Honeywell Bull Inc, Honeywell said.
      ""Our first quarter results show clear benefits of our
  restructuring,"" chairman Edson Spencer said. ""All of our
  businesses are producing better results than last year, even
  though we do not see significant improvement in the external
  market environment,"" he said.
      Total orders in the first quarter were up substantially,
  with a sharp increase in aerospace and defense orders in
  addition to those of the new Sperry Aerospace group, it said.
      Domestic industrial automation and control orders were
  modestly higher than the same period in 1986, it said.
      Orders in Honeywell's home and building automation and

  Robert Heller, a member of the

  growth in the money supply this year.
      ""In my view, this would not only be a logical, but also a
  most desireable development,"" he said in a speech prepared for
  delivery to an economic forum at Chapman College in Orange,
  Calif.
      A text was released in Washington.
      He said the effect of lower inflation and financial
  deregulation on monetary aggregates was now largely finished.
      ""Consequently, monetary growth may return to more modest
  levels,"" Heller said. He noted growth in the money supply slowed
  after mid-January.
      ""I would not be surprised at all if the monetary aggregates
  were to grow rather slowly during the balance of the year as
  well,"" he added.
      Heller said there was a danger of renewed price inflation.
      ""The pricing behavior of American producers in response to
  price increases of their foreign competitors will be crucial
  for our economic future,"" he said.
      Widespread domestic price rises in response to rising
  import prices would ""generalize the inflationary forces
  emanating from the foreign trade sector"" and might not gain more
  market share for U.S. producers.
      ""A return to the stagflation of the late 1970s may well be
  the result of such a behavior pattern,"" Heller warned.
      He said ""we at the Federal Reserve will have to be
  disciplined in our conduct of monetary policy."" 
      Heller said said the government should also exercise fiscal
  discipline and cut the deficit by spending restraint rather
  than new taxes.
      ""The imposition of new taxes would tend to rekindle
  inflation and certainly would not make us more competitive in
  international markets,"" Heller said.
      He said the U.S. economy should expand by nearly three pct
  during 1987, aided by higher exports to Europe and Canada.
      A free trade agreement currently being negotiated with
  Canada ""would be exceedingly helpful in allowing American

"['cotton', 'grain', 'rice', 'trade']","PAKISTAN UNVEILS NEW TRADE POLICY TO BOOST EXPORTS
  Pakistani government allowed freer
  cotton and rice export in a three-year new trade policy aimed
  at narrowing the country's yawning trade gap.
      Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a
  televised speech the government had also decided to allow
  duty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industry
  more competitive, and to link bulk tea imports to the export of
  Pakistani products.
     
      Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which have
  been handled exclusively by state corporations since early
  1970s.
      But Haq said now the private sector would also export
  cotton and rice along with the corporations, which meets a
  long-standing demand of the local traders.
      The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed to
  bring down prices and help the local ancillary industries
  compete effectively in the world market, he said.
     
      Haq said the new policy, effective from the fiscal year
  1987/88 beginning on July 1, would be for three years but
  reviewed every year.
      It was a departure from the previous practice of announcing
  trade policies for a single fiscal year, and Haq said it would
  enable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over a
  longer period.
      He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been provided
  for the export of engineering goods to selected third world
  countries on soft credit terms.
     
      Pakistan's 1986/87 exports at 3.6 billion dlrs, 18.2 per
  cent more than in the previous year, and imports at 5.23
  billion dlrs compared to 5.63 billion dlrs in 1985/86.
      He said the government policy was to rationalise and
  streamline import controls.
      ""It has been observed that due to restrictions on imports,
  specially on raw materials and intermediate goods, local
  industry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs,"" he
  said. ""Prices have been on the increase and quality of goods
  produced has been low. This restrictive policy also gave rise
  to smuggling and hampering of exports.""
     
      He said that to correct this situation, 136 items had freed
  from import restrictions.
      Previously, Pakistan has met its trade gap largely from
  remittances from its nationals working abroad, mainly in the
  Gulf. However, the remittances have begun to fall after the
  drop in oil prices in recent years leading to the spectre of a
  balance of payments crisis for Pakistan.

  U.S. strike against its oil platform though he said Iranian
  options were limited.
      ""They will be determined. They will not be easily deterred,
  and let me stress for you that our commitment there is not
  going to be risk free or casualty free.""
      He said the most likely Iranian response would involve
  terrorism or the laying of mines.
      ""They obviously will look for ways that are probably more in
  line with the 'silent hand' than what they have tried thus far,""
  Crowe told an American Stock Exchange conference.
      He declined comment on a reporter's query whether he
  favored a stronger move against Iran than that ordered by the
  president.
      ""We carried out the operation that was decided upon and we
  carried it out with enthusiasm and I think it was
  professionally and well done,"" Crowe said.

  Overseas Shipholding Group Inc president
  Morton Hyman said if oil production by OPEC rises during the
  second half of 1987, freight rates for tankers should rise
  accordingly.
      Hyman, delivering a speech at the annual shareholders
  meeting, said international tanker markets were generally weak
  throughout the first quarter, but since the end of March OPEC
  oil production has picked up. The result has been a modest
  improvement in tanker rates.
      Overseas said 73 pct of its fleet handles liquid cargo.
     
      He said tanker requirements decreased in September 1986 as
  OPEC production quotas dropped and levels of oil stocks rose.
      For the first quarter 1987, the company reported net income
  of 10.3 mln dlrs, or 40 cts per share, compared to 9.3 mln
  dlrs, or 36 cts per share, for the comparable quarter a year
  ago.
      The company reported net income for 1986 of 37.3 mln dlrs,
  or 1.45 dlrs per share.
     
      ""The improvement in the company's 1986 results, after four
  years of declining earnings, reflects a sharp, albeit
  temporary, rise in freight rates in the international tanker
  markets last summer,"" Hyman said.
      He said the Alaskan oil trade continues to be the principal

['crude'],"KUWAITI DAILY SAYS OPEC CREDIBILITY AT STAKE
  OPEC's credibility faces fresh scrutiny
  in coming weeks amid signs of a significant rise in supplies of
  oil to international oil markets, the Kuwait daily al-Qabas
  said.
      In an article headlined, ""Gulf oil sources say Middle East
  production up 1.4 mln bpd,"" it warned OPEC's official prices
  could face fresh pressure from international oil companies
  seeking cheaper supplies.
      It did not say whether only OPEC or both OPEC and other
  producers were behind the reported rise in Mideast output. Nor
  did it specify if the sources were official or other contacts. 
     ""The sources said the credibility of OPEC would come under
  fresh scrutiny from today (Monday), with activity in the
  European and American markets,"" the daily said.
      The sources were quoted as saying that after OPEC had in
  March demonstrated its commitment to quota agreements, some
  members had raised output last week. It gave no details.
      ""Dealers in oil markets were now waiting to see if Opec was
  able to control production, or whether the days of cheating and
  producing over quotas has begun anew,"" it said.
      The sources warned that ""maybe the (price of a) barrel of
  oil will fall below 18, perhaps 17.80 dlrs this week or next if
  there is no control on supplies,"" it said.
      ""The sources believed a return of oil below 18 dlrs a barrel
  may open the doors for international oil companies to pressure
  OPEC over contract prices, similar to the struggle last March,""

  Robert Fildes, president and chief

  is not interested in buying Cetus.
      Earlier the companies said Squibb would buy from Cetus a
  five pct equity postion in Cetus for about 40 mln dlrs.
      ""This is not an attempt by Squibb to become a major
  majority holder in Cetus,"" Fildes told Reuters in an interview.
  ""Squibb has not approached us with any indication that they
  want to acquire us and we wouldn't be interested in that kind
  of arrangement,"" said Fildes.
      Squibb could not be reached to comment on the late comments
  by Fildes.
      Squibb is Cetus' first pharmaceutical partner and the only
  one to own an equity position in Cetus. Eastman Kodak Co &lt;EK>
  and W.R. Grace &lt;WR> both have joint ventures with Cetus, but
  neither owns an equity position in the company, said Fildes.
      Cetus has a venture with Kodak to develp diagnostic
  products and with Grace to develop agricultural products.
      Earlier, Squibb and Cetus announced in a joint statement 
  an agreement in principle to form a joint venture to develop
  new biotechnology products in several fields.
     
      As part of the deal Squibb will license several of Cetus'
  anticancer agents, including interleukin-2, in development.
  Squibb will sell the drugs only in Japan and other markets but
  not in North American and Western Europe.
      ""We wouldn't have done this deal had it not been understood
  that Cetus wants to build its own fully integrated business in
  North America and Europe,"" said Fildes.
      He said Squibb was the good partner because Squibb has a
  major joint venture in Japan and has sales capabilities of its
  own in that market.
     
      Fildes said Cetus has shunned licensing arrangements with
  pharmaceutical companies because it wanted to build its own
  business. Many large corporations have invested in small
  biotech firms.
      But Squibb's investment in Cetus is the first it has made
  in biotechnology. Fildes said that was attractive to Cetus
  because it wanted a partner that didn't have a relationship
  with a large number of other biotechnology companies.""
     
      Fildes said his strategy was to have partners in non drug
  areas like diagnostics and agriculture, but to ""keep the
  biggest developments in anticancer drugs to ourselves.""
      Fildes said the partnership with Squibb would be used to
  broaden the company's reach in such big money making areas
  as the cardiovascular, anti-infective and the anti-inflammatory
  markets.
      Squibb is also investming 75 mln dlrs in Cetus' research
  over the next five years.

  of the package is simply to demonstrate the seriousness of this

"['acq', 'trade']","ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - TELECOM IS KEY JAPAN MINISTRY
  Japan's little-known Ministry of Posts and
  Telecommunications (MPT) has emerged as an international force
  to be reckoned with, political analysts said.
      MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S.
  And Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control of
  a lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians,
  they said.
      ""The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of
  a key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,""
  said one diplomatic source.
      ""They are a potent political force,"" the diplomatic source
  said.
      But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not
  always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analysts
  said.
      ""The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not
  so internationalized,"" said Waseda University professor Mitsuru
  Uchida. ""Suddenly they're standing at the centre of the world
  community and in that sense, they're at a loss (as to) how to
  face the situation.""
      Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with
  London over efforts by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc to keep
  a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in
  Japan's lucrative overseas telephone business.
      The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival
  groups, arguing the market cannot support more than one
  competitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which now
  monopolizes the business.
      It has also opposed a major management role in the planned
  merger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on
  the grounds that no such international precedent exists.
      The ministry's stance has outraged both London, which has
  threatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the merger
  plan is evidence of Japan's failure to honour pledges to open
  its telecommunications market.
      Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it
  says have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan's car
  telephone and satellite communications market.
      Much of MPT's new prominence stems from the growth of the
  sector it regulates.
      ""What has been happening is an important shift in the
  economy which makes the ministry a very important place,"" said
  James Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory
  Service Inc.
      A decision to open the telecommunications industry to
  competition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted
  rather than lessened MPT's authority, analysts said.
      ""With the legal framework eased, they became the de facto
  legal framework,"" said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst Darrell
  Whitten.
      Close links with the powerful political faction of the
  ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former Prime
  Minister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT's influence, the
  analysts said.
      ""Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanaka
  faction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importance
  of MPT,"" Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of
  the influential political group, he added.
      The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to
  the more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the
  Postal Savings System, analysts said.
      MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate
  interest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial
  liberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal
  Savings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates than
  banks, they said.
      Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT's
  obstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized
  the ministry as feudal.
      Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting
  competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its
  wing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest
  price takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.
      But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those of
  its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world
  including Britain, several analysts said.
      ""The United States is really the odd man out,"" Abegglen said.
  ""For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order
  in utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable
  view,"" he said.

"['bop', 'cpi', 'gnp']","PORTUGUESE ECONOMY REMAINS BUOYANT DESPITE CRISIS
  Portugal's economy, which has been
  enjoying one of its most buoyant periods in more than a decade,
  may now be strong enough to shrug off the country's latest
  government crisis, analysts said.
      But the April 3 ousting of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco
  Silva's government could slow economic reforms and investment
  as Portugal continues to adapt to membership in the European
  Community, which it joined in January last year, they said.
      Cavaco Silva's minority Social Democratic Party, PSD, was
  toppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left-wing parties.
      The centre-right administration had made economic growth
  reform a priority in its 17 months in office.
      In 1986, Portugal's economy grew four pct, its current
  account surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs and
  inflation fell to 10 pct, from 20 pct in 1985.
      Analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instability
  were worrying but they felt the foundations for continued
  growth had not been badly shaken.
      ""The economy has developed a certain self-confidence that is
  now less dependent on the political situation,"" said Fritz
  Haser, economics professor at Universidade Livre, Lisbon.
      ""The market doesn't see this as a real crisis yet,"" economist
  Jorge Braga de Macedo told Reuters.
      Businessmen have identified political instability over the
  last 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lasting
  economic progress.
      The PSD administration was the 16th formed since the 1974
  revolution.
      Portugal's developing stock markets, however, remain
  buoyant. Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surge
  in economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largely
  underpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts.
      Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank of
  Portugal forecast, released on the day the PSD government fell,
  predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growth
  would remain at similar levels this year.
      But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policies
  and could slow economic development.
      Soares, who is expected to announce a decision by the end
  of the month, can either call early elections or form a new
  government from parties in the existing left wing-dominated
  parliament.
      Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quick
  elections as the best solution. ""There is a good chance that a
  majority government could result from early elections,""
  Confederation of Portuguese Industry (CIP) president Pedro
  Ferraz da Costa said.
      He said they were optimistic this could mean the
  continuation in the near future of liberalisation policies
  introduced over the last year.
      The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution, but
  the PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion polls
  say they could win an overall majority.
      A PSD majority would also open the way for more
  wide-ranging reforms, such as relaxation of labour laws and
  possible denationalisation of industry, the analysts said.
      Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition parties
  of blocking key economic reforms.
      The left-wingers said Portugal's positive economic results
  were more the product of favourable international conditions
  such as cheaper oil and raw material imports, than of PSD
  policies.

"['gnp', 'housing', 'income']","BANK OF AMERICA SEES SLOW U.S. CONSUMER SPENDING
  A trade-led boom in the U.S. is
  unlikely this year or next because growth in net exports will
  merely offset a dramatic slowdown in consumer spending and
  other sectors of the economy, Bank of America said in its
  latest economic report.
      Although net exports will add 0.7 pct to GNP this year,
  after reducing it by 1.2 pct in 1986, consumer spending will
  contribute 1.4 pct less to GNP than it did last year.
      As a result, GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 2.5
  pct, the same rate as last year, according to Daniel Van Dyke,
  the Bank of America economist who wrote the report.
      ""Growth in consumer spending in the United States will drop
  dramatically this year because the jump in inflation will cause
  a falloff in the growth of disposable income,"" Van Dyke said.
      Growth in U.S. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8
  pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted.
      The report was released before the Commerce Department
  reported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in May,
  after increasing 0.4 pct in April, and that personal
  consumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared with
  a 0.6 pct increase the month before.
      The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boost
  consumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9
  pct in 1986, Bank of America forecast.
      This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income 
  growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986.
      As a result, Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing power
  of an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrs
  this year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986.
      The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housing
  starts to drop by 4.2 pct this year and a further six pct in
  1988 to an annual rate of 1.63 mln units.
      ""For the first time in several years, a recession in 1988
  or 1989 is more than a remote possibility,"" Van Dyke said.
      Currently, U.S. growth is fragile and depends heavily on an
  improvement in trade. ""However, with protectionist attitudes on
  the rise in this country, this source of growth is at risk,"" he
  added.

['acq'],"SAN MIGUEL DEAL HIT BY MORE LAWSUITS
  A bid by San Miguel Corp (SMC) &lt;SANM.MN>
  to buy back 38.1 mln sequestered shares from United Coconut
  Planters Bank (UCPB) has been hit by two new lawsuits, sources
  in the Philippine food and brewery company said.
      A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPB
  from selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of SMC's
  outstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings on
  April 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco, a former
  chairman of both SMC and UCPB.
      Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF)
  and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares.
      Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB and
  represented a blue chip investment. His petition said UCPB's
  plans to sell the shares to SMC were ""a serious breach of
  fiduciary duties.""
      The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also be
  held up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securities
  and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, a
  government nominee on the company's board.
      De los Angeles, who represents SMC's minority stockholders,
  asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week by
  the company's board.
      On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the
  sequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per
  share. De los Angeles told the SEC the company's retained
  earnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by the
  purchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of
  dividends.
      De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violate
  an SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debt
  to equity ratio. He quoted SMC's chief financial director Ramon
  del Rosario as telling the board that the transaction would
  boost the ratio to 2.5-to-1.
      In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earlier
  suit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman Andres
  Soriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties.
      De los Angeles' earlier complaint related to SMC assuming
  last December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC's Hong Kong
  subsidiary &lt;Neptunia Corp> for a down payment on the shares.
  The loan assumption was again ratified by last week's board
  meeting.
      An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino to
  resolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by
  April 15.
      ""The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part of
  a continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregard
  of the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an early
  disposition of the sequestered shares,"" San Miguel Corp said in
  a statement.
      ""Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB have
  reached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of
  payment, this suit is in direct contravention of the
  government's expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement
  of the controversy by April 15,"" the statement added.
      A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment on
  Cojuangco's court petition, adding: ""Any statement coming from
  us might be interpreted as adversarial.""
      Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel which
  sequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligible
  to buy the major portion of the shares because he was a United
  States citizen.
      The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln ""A"" shares,
  which can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln ""B"" shares which
  are available to foreign buyers.
      SMC sources said Soriano personally was not among
  prospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased by
  the &lt;A.Soriano> group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamed
  institutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyers
  in a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB.
      The sale was aborted when Diaz's Presidential Commission on
  Good Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were
  owned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former President
  Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in the
  U.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend
  announced last June.
      ""We have no objection to Soriano buying the ""B"" shares,"" Diaz
  told Reuters. ""But everything is on hold now.""
      The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversy
  would be resolved before the company's annual stockholders'
  meeting, scheduled for May 14.
      San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billion
  pesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in
  1985. It said unaudited net profit was in the neighbourhood of
  700 mln pesos, an increase of about 50 pct over 1985.

  Zimbabwe's beef exports to the European
  Community (EC), potentially worth 70 mln Zimbabwean dlrs this
  year, may be jeopardised by an outbreak of foot and mouth
  disease in southwestern Matabeleland, industry sources said.
      The country has temporarily suspended beef exports to the
  EC because of the outbreak and awaits a decision from the EC
  veterinary committee, which is considering a formal ban.
      The outbreak in the country's main ranching province has
  already led neighbouring beef-producing Botswana and Zambia to
  bar beef and dairy imports from Zimbabwe, threatening the dairy
  industry with a loss of at least one mln dlrs in export
  revenue.
      ""The situation is still uncertain at the moment. Normally
  when an outbreak occurs there is an automatic suspension of
  beef exports,"" one industry source said yesterday.
       Commenting on EC policy, he explained, ""Depending on the
  seriousness of the outbreak the (veterinary) committee then
  decides on three options, allowing us to continue exporting
  beef from disease-free areas, clamping a three-month suspension
  on exports or banning us from exporting for a year. We are
  still awaiting their decision,"" he added, asking not to be
  identified.
      Zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8,100 tonnes of
  high-grade beef to EC markets in 1985 after the country had
  spent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences and
  upgrading abattoirs to meet stringent EC rules.
      Should the EC ban Zimbabwean exports, the country will be
  forced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at low
  prices, the source said. Projected earnings from beef sales
  could fall about 23 mln dlrs as a result, he said.

"['dlr', 'money-fx']","EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE
  European currency markets reacted quietly
  to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers
  ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to
  surprise that the markets should have expected so much.
      The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies
  and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which
  reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency
  stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.
      Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining
  broadly entrenched in its current trading range.
      ""The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84
  marks,"" said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank
  AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.
      However, she said the dollar could break out of the range
  with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.
  Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.
      Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd
  in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against
  the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,
  possibly to 140 yen.
      A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects
  a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.
      London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb
  underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative
  sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank
  operators to test the downside.
      Concern that finance ministers and officials still in
  Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of
  currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with
  worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the
  near term, the traders said.
      Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the
  communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's
  downward trend.
      Traders in several centres said the market would look for
  fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to
  defend current ranges, which the communique said were ""broadly
  consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy
  intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.""
      Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said
  ""They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon."" The
  U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.
      However, some dealers said London-based operators would be
  unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long
  Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825
  marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.
      Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said
  the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable
  market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme
  volatility seen in the first few months of this year.
      One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the
  communique made clear the leading nations did not want a
  further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.
      The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to
  1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre
  accord's supposed currency target range.
      A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were
  ready for a period of ""mainly sideways movement.""
      But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique
  contributing to greater stability.
      ""Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big
  boost,"" said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he
  expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks
  in the next three months.
      A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, said
  the communique had been in line with realistic expectations and
  should not have produced disappointment.
      ""The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and trade
  policies to redress current imbalances are of a different
  timescale than currency markets operate on,"" the source told
  Reuters, ""This is a political process which takes time.""
      Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp in
  Basle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident on
  currency markets today. ""Did people really expect a patent
  remedy?"" he asked.
      Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday's meeting was only
  the first in a series and said the market would watch carefully
  in the next few weeks for any changes in positions.
      A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus was
  now on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move by
  Japan and West Germany to boost their economic growth could
  lead to a quick change in the U.S. Position.
      Dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary in
  pushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming months
  while central banks appear resolved to use their muscle to
  support the Paris accord.

      In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation, the

  Cold and wet weather in northern,
  western and central parts of Europe continued to slow beet
  growth but plant density is reported to be good in most
  countries, sugar statistician F.O. Licht said.
      Temperatures were too low for the season and the rain has
  hampered field work and occasionally led to water-logged
  fields.
      But in eastern and southeastern Europe, warmer weather has
  boosted sugar beet growth.
      Weather in the Soviet Union also allowed good beet
  development, Licht said.
      In Sweden beet growth has been delayed, although plant
  population is reported to be regular and good. Cool and rainy
  weather slowed beet growth in Denmark and crop prospects are
  rated as slightly below normal.
      In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it was rather cool with
  heavy rainfall in places which has delayed beet growth.
      In France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and West Germany, it
  was mostly cool with frequent and often heavy rainfall which
  continued to slow down beet growth and often made field work
  impossible.
      In Austria, it was warm with some rainfall, which was
  favourable for beet growth, Licht said.
      In Czechoslovakia and Poland, it was mostly warm, favouring
  beet development. but some heavy rain may have caused damage.
      In the European beet growing regions of the Soviet Union,
  it was warm with showers over most areas and weather was
  generally good for the emergence and growth of beets.
      In south eastern Europe, warm weather with some rainfall
  boosted beet development.
      Labour trouble threatens the beet crop in Spain. Disputes
  between the factories and the trade unions are threatening to
  delay the start of processing in the southern areas, where
  beets are maturing very early this year.

['interest'],"U.K. LENDERS OFFER MORE FIXED RATE MORTGAGES
  More U.K. Lenders are offering homebuyers
  fixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes
  the same monthly payment no matter what happens to other
  interest rates.
      And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in
  years, the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers
  trying to lock into cheap money.
      The decision to offer fixed rate loans, industry officials
  said, reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home
  mortgage business.
      While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the U.K., They
  were the mainstay of the business in the U.S. Up until only a
  few years ago.
      But in the early 1980s interest rates soared. U.S. Lenders,
  mostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as low
  as three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their
  portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to
  induce them to retain their accounts.
      As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were
  forced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whose
  rates would move in line with the cost of funds.
      ""We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,""
  said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society,
  explaining why his institution, for the time being, is only
  offering variable rate mortgages.
      The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped
  homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders
  concede they are being forced to undercut each other still
  more.
      Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier
  this week by the nation's two largest building societies and by
  National Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition for
  new business, officials at all three institutions said.
      The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even
  below those on the variable rate loans.
      ""Of course they are less profitable than other (variable
  rate) mortgages,"" said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, which
  earlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate
  new mortgage loans.
      But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable
  loans because, ""It was just another way to attract people to our
  mortgage product.""
      Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixed
  rate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year.
      The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans was
  exhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman.
      ""Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage,"" she said, noting
  that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct
  of its 1986 volume.
      In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they
  offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest
  rates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the
  lender is earning an above average return on assets.
      But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won
  the benefit of cheap money.
      Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed
  rate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumption
  that a Conservative Party victory would help money market rates
  fall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director.
      Young explained that the company had planned to protect
  itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a
  complicated hedging instrument.
      But money market rates have risen contrary to expectations
  and the company has shelved its plans for the time being. He
  said money market rates were too high to arrange both the
  mortgages and hedge profitably.
      However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does
  make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. This
  means bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond
  and selling them to an investor.
      For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more
  efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate
  mortgages. In the U.S., Where fixed rate mortgages are popular
  again, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money
  over the past few years.

"['bop', 'cpi', 'gnp', 'jobs']","INSTITUTES DIVIDED ON OUTLOOK FOR GERMAN ECONOMY
  The five leading West German economic
  research institutes have failed to agree about how strongly the
  domestic economy will expand this year but revised down
  forecasts contained in a report published six months ago.
      The three research groups of Kiel, Hamburg and Essen
  predicted in the institutes' joint spring report that gross
  national product (GNP) would rise by two pct in 1987, compared
  with 2.4 pct in 1986. The five institutes had jointly forecast
  three pct 1987 growth in October last year.
      Taking a dissenting view, the DIW institute of West Berlin
  and Munich's Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth.
      The joint report said that the estimates of economic
  development made by the DIW and Ifo were ""markedly less
  favourable"" than those of the other three.
      The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a
  slow start to the year. ""In the second half of 1987 there will,
  however, only be a weak upward movement,"" they said.
      The two institutes said external economic factors which
  were currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would
  dominate the economic environment throughout the year. They saw
  exports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted no
  marked improvement in the course of the year.
      The other three institutes, however, wrote: ""The decline in
  demand and production (seen) in the winter months does not
  indicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing.""
      They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate
  uncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans.
  But they expected that many investments had not been cancelled
  but only put off. ""It can be presumed that the braking actions
  (on the economy) will diminish markedly this year.""
      They added: ""The domestic prerequisites for a continuation
  of the economic uptrend are still favourable.""
      These three institutes said diminishing external burdens
  combined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in
  demand and production could be expected by the spring.
      However, this projection was clouded by risks including the
  further development of the mark against the dollar.
      Contrary to the DIW and Ifo, the three institutes said that
  while exports would continue to be the weak point of the
  economy in 1987, ""there is good reason to believe that exports
  will soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during
  the course of the year."" They predicted an overall 0.5 pct fall
  in exports in 1987, the same as in 1986.
      The three more positive institutes saw private consumption
  rising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986,
  while DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase.
      They saw the climate for equipment investment improving but
  predicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in
  1986. Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct.
      All the institutes predicted only a slight decline in
  unemployment. The Kiel, Hamburg and Essen institutes said the
  jobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23
  mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people in
  work of about 200,000.
      These three institutes said new jobs would be created
  mainly in the private services sector and also by the state in
  the context of job creation measures. The construction industry
  was likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980
  but they predicted either no rise in employment in the
  manufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion.
      The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur only
  in the tertiary sector, while ""the number employed in the
  manufacturing industry will decline.""
      The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to
  2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986.
      They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58
  billion marks from 78 billion in 1986. The other three saw a
  current account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marks
  and predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around
  100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986.
      The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start to
  rise in 1987, after they declined in 1986, and all five
  predicted an average increase over the year of 0.5 pct.

      The committee also voted for legally-binding quantity and
  quality requirements on the materials, mostly metals.
      The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Bill
  which will be voted on in the House next month.
      The purpose of the measures, passed by the committee
  yesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discourage
  sell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, a
  staff member of the committee told Reuters.
      ""They (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by being
  managed properly,"" said the staffer. ""Management of the stockpile
  over the last 10 years has been atrocious.""
      Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to a

      The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrs

"['interest', 'money-fx']","BUNDESBANK CREDIT POLICY CHANGES UNLIKELY
  The Bundesbank is unlikely to change
  credit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursday
  for its last session before the Venice summit, banking
  economists and money market dealers said.
      The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month
  by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and is
  unlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates
  in the near future, they said.
      The council will meet in Saarbruecken, and the meeting will
  be followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT.
      But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was
  usually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt, and
  did not necessarily herald any policy moves.
      Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger said today
  there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply
  growth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar was
  stable against the mark.
      Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo, where the Bundesbank has
  opened a representative office, that the West German economy
  was now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted
  1/2 to one pct in the first quarter.
      Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in
  a 3.50/70 pct range for most of this month, after the
  Bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a
  minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, allocating funds at 3.55 pct.
      ""They have set this signal and indicated they could maybe
  lower market rates even further, but not with the discount or
  Lombard,"" Winfried Hutmann, chief economist of Schroeder,
  Munchmeyer, Hengst Investment GmbH said.
      Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said
  German rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and
  around historical lows for West Germany.
      A further cut in rates would have little impact on the
  economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand,
  with companies swimming in liquidity, Chrobok said.
      The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move
  on interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve.
  ""The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder,"" he said.
      A cut in the discount or Lombard rates, to bring them in
  line with the new structure of money market rates since last
  month, would have little practical significance, dealers said.
      The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a
  diplomatic gesture before next week's Venice summit.
      But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made it
  clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere ""eyewash.""
      Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government to
  cut taxes, rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetary
  policy, to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit.
      But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced tax
  cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget
  deficit, it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further.
      ""The Bonn government will be in a very weak position in
  Venice because they can't risk increasing the deficit further,""
  said Schroeder, Muenchmeyer, Hengst's Hutmann.
      Bethmann's Chrobok said if anything is to happen before
  Venice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy. ""But I
  don't expect any convincing measures,"" he said.
      Money market dealers noted that call money continued to
  normalize today, falling to 3.60/70 pct from 3.75/85 yesterday
  and as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up by
  month-end distortions.
      Call money could come under upwards pressure later this
  month because of a major round of tax payments by banks on
  behalf of customers, starting in the week beginning June 15.
  Two public holidays that week could also distort the market.
      Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate funds
  tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55
  pct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct,
  and to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact.
      But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank would
  allocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55. That would not
  represent a tightening of policy, however.
      Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates
  at the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a full
  allocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said.
      On another issue, Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likely
  to lift restrictions on private use of the European Currency
  Unit (ECU) at one of its meetings soon.
      Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement
  on this gesture to European unity, as it is the capital of the
  Saarland bordering France, and was twice under French
  occupation this century.
      But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to come
  this week, as a number of technical and legal matters had still
  to be resolved, for instance how German ECU accounts would be
  treated for minimum reserve purposes.

       ""They were very frustrated with their inability to get

      American Brands failed late last year in its 2.9 billion

      ""This is just typical,"" said George Thompson of
  Prudential-Bache securities. ""There's going to be more to come
  here. American Brands had to make an acquisition because
  tobacco is still a significant part of earnings. Their position
  is a little less favorable than Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds,""
  he said.
  cash flow from its low growth tobacco, but the tobacco business
  does require great amounts of capital expenditures. It can
  therefore use its funds to make acquisitions. Analysts said the
  National Distillers' spirits company, which makes Gilbey's gin
  and vodka, Old Grandad and Old Crow whiskey, is not quite the
  type of acquisition they envisioned.
      ""The distilled spirits business has been in a steady

  third company which could lead to an offer, Dome said in a
  statement.
      The statement confirmed Dome received TransCanada's bid,
  but did not identify the companies involved in talks.
      TransCanada, Canada's largest natural gas pipeline
  operator, said it is offering Dome a package of cash, common
  and preferred shares, and shares in a new subsidiary which
  would own and operate Dome's assets. TransCanada said the offer
  is to Dome management, not to shareholders.
      Dome has massive oil and gas landholdings in Canada,
  totalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed.
  It also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs.
      Dome's statement said the TransCanada announcement ""violated
  the terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement entered
  into with prospective purchasers"" and was apparently timed to
  prevent Dome from considering other proposals.
      It said the TransCanada bid ""seems to require favourable and
  substantial taxation concessions from the federal and
  provincial governments."" But Dome added that its management and
  financial advisers will evaluate all proposals.
      TransCanada chief financial officer H. Neil Nichols said he
  was surprised at the vehemence of Dome's statement and denied
  that TransCanada was trying to usurp other bids. ""I find (Dome's
  statement) very bothersome. Once the board made the decision to
  authorise the proposal, it had a legal obligation to announce
  it,"" he said. Nichols said he did not know the identity of the
  other bidders, or the terms of other offers.
      Dome common shares closed at 1.13 dlrs on Friday on the
  Toronto Stock Exchange. The preferred class A stock closed at
  5.00 dlrs. Common stock traded as high as 25.00 dlrs in 1981.

  House Speaker Jim Wright predicted
  passage of legislation requiring the Reagan administration to
  provide Congress with a report on its Mideast Gulf policy, but
  a last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberals and
  conservatives left the bill's fate in doubt.
      The legislation was written in the wake of the May 17th
  Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf,
  which killed 37 Americans, and President Reagan's decision to
  protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags
  -- effectively making them American ships.
      Since the administration made known its reflagging plans,
  congressional leaders complained they had not been consulted,
  and some charged the policy could lead the United States into
  the 6 1/2-year-old war between Iran and Iraq.
      The House was to vote today on a bill -- supported by the
  Democratic and Republican congressional leadership and the
  administration -- which demanded a report within seven days on
  plans to meet the security needs of U.S. forces in the gulf.
      The resolution was expected to pass without controversy
  today in the House Foreign Affairs Committee before the full
  House was to take up the bill. But in a surprise move, liberal
  Democrats and conservative Republicans on the committee joined
  in an unusual alliance to oppose the resolution.
      Liberal Democrats said a lack of any restrictions in the

  Japanese trade figures are seriously
  challenging the entrenched view of policy makers of the Group
  of Seven industrialised nations that relative currency rates
  are the key to smoothing world trade problems.
      Senior Japanese, U.S. And European officials in Tokyo say
  they are at a loss to fully explain the data, for if currencies
  are the key they ask, why then are are U.S. Exports to Japan
  shrinking?
      What if manipulating currencies and driving the dollar down
  made world trade problems worse rather than solving them,
  fulfilling Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's forecast of
  world trade recession?
      U.S.-Japan trade has declined even after a 40 pct dollar
  fall against the yen since the September 1985 Group of Five
  pact in New York.
      The lower dollar ought to have made U.S. Exports 40 pct
  more competitive in Japan. The officials, most of them
  economists, can offer no objective reason why they are not.
      Worse, how are European Community sales to Japan rising
  rapidly when the European Currency Unit has until now declined
  only 11 pct against the yen.?
      Last week's G-7 meeting in Washington has been widely
  interpreted as a sign from the policy makers that the dollar
  must go lower. So worst of all, what if Volcker is correct?
      At a loss to give an objective explanation, officials can
  only offer explanations which tend to be highly subjective.

  Richardson, acting head of the EC delegation in Tokyo.
      ""What I do know is that Community exporters are making a
  hell of an effort in this market. If you make an effort, there
  is money to be made in Japan,"" he added.
      But U.S. Officials and businessmen are convinced low U.S.
  Exports to Japan are Japan's fault. They cite restrictive trade
  practices, protected Japanese trade sectors, such as
  agriculture, and non-tariff barriers, such as unreasonable
  checking and customs procedures for car imports.
      Publicly, Japanese officials remain conciliatory in the
  face of what they see as U.S. Aggression. In private, they
  blame U.S. Industry for being uncompetitive.
      ""We see it that way, but we don't like to seem arrogant,""
  said a senior official, who declined to be named. ""We like to
  refrain from accusing them of not making enough effort.""
      Industrialists such as Eishiro Saito, chairman of the
  Keidanren business group, and Sony Corp chairman Akio Morita
  repeatedly accuse foreign firms of not making enough effort to
  understand Japan's markets, and some foreigners agree. ""The real
  issue is the inability of major sectors of American and
  European industry to compete not only internationally but even
  in their home markets,"" Peter Huggler, President of Interallianz
  Bank Zurich, told a recent conference in Switzerland.

['ipi'],"SOVIET INDUSTRIAL GROWTH/TRADE SLOWER IN 1987
  The Soviet Union's industrial output is
  growing at a slower pace in 1987 than in 1986 and foreign trade
  has fallen, Central Statistical Office figures show.
      Figures in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda show
  industrial production rose 3.6 pct in the first nine months of
  1987 against 5.2 pct in the same 1986 period.
      Foreign trade in the same period fell 3.6 pct from the 1986
  period as exports fell by 0.5 pct and imports dropped by 4.2
  pct.
      Foreign trade in the nine months totalled 94.2 billion
  roubles. Separate import and export figures were not given.
      One factor affecting industrial growth was the introduction
  of a new quality control plan, Western economists said. Last
  year's calculations of industrial output included all goods,
  irrespective of quality.
      Under the new plan, introduced in line with Soviet leader
  Mikhail Gorbachev's drive to modernise the economy, special
  inspectors have the right to reject goods they consider below
  standard.
      Pravda said 42 mln roubles worth of defective goods were
  rejected in the nine-month period.
      The figures also showed that on October 1, there were more
  than 8,000 cooperative enterprises employing over 80,000
  people. More than 200,000 were employed in the private sector,
  Pravda said, without giving comparative figures.
      The promotion of the cooperative and private sectors of the
  economy has been an important part of the modernisation
  campaign, with measures introduced recently to allow the
  setting up of small shops on a private basis.
      Labour productivity rose 3.7 pct in the first nine months
  against 4.8 pct growth in January to September 1986.
      But western economists said they treat Soviet productivity
  figures with caution, as they are more broadly based than in
  the West, which measures worker output over a given period.
      Pravda said there were 283.8 mln people in the Soviet Union
  as of October 1. In the January to September 1987 period 118.5
  mln people were employed, a rise of 4.4 pct on the same period
  last year. Average earnings were 200 roubles a month against
  194 roubles a year ago.

  U.S. District Court Judge Eugene
  A. Gordon said he plans to issue a decision tomorrow on
  Burlington Industries Inc's request for an injunction to stop
  Samjens Acquisition Corp's takeover bid for the company.
      Wall Street sources have said the outcome of the case could
  be pivotal in determining the winner in the fierce takeover
  battle for Burlington, the largest u.s. textile maker.
      Gordon presided over six hours of argument today by lawyers
  for Burlington and Samjens, a partnership formed by Dominion
  Textile Inc and New York investor Asher Edelman.
      Hearings are scheduled to continue tomorrow. A preliminary
  injunction would hold up Samjens 2.47 billion dlr offer until
  the case is decided.
      Burlington had previously agreed to a 2.44 billion dlr
  buyout from Morgan Stanley Group Inc &lt;MS>, one dlr per share
  lower than a sweetened 77 dlr per share bid made by Samjens
  last week. Burlington has not responded to the new Samjens
  offer.
      Burlington has alleged in its lawsuit that Edelman and
  Dominion used illegally obtained confidential information about
  the company in making their takeover attempt.
   
      That information, Burlington said, was provided by James
  Ammeen, a former Burlington executive, through PaineWebber
  Group Inc &lt;PWJ>. Ammeen, who had worked for Burlington for 23
  years, had as many as 12 divisions with 50 pct of Burlington's
  sales reporting to him. When he left Burlington in November,
  1985, Burlington said he signed a contract promising never to
  divulge inside information about the company.
      Burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he began
  working with a PaineWebber employee on a hostile plan to
  ""takeover the company, dismember the company and displace its
  management,"" Burlington lawyer Hubert Humphrey said.
      Samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information from
  PaineWebber, but argued the information was public information
  and could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts or
  Burlington's public financial statements.
      Burlington lawyers said PaineWebber and Ammeen met with
  Edelman and Dominion in November and continued to meet with
  them until a couple of days before Edelman and Dominion went
  public April 24 with their intention to take over the company.
  Burlington lawyers claim Dominion's board decided to attempt a
  takeover of Burlington after Ammeen met with the board in
  February.
      Burlington lawyers said Edelman and Dominion held
  discussions with PaineWebber and Ammeen about acting as
  financial advisers to Samjens. But they allege talks broke off
  because Painewebber and Ammeen could not satisfy Edelman and
  dominion with a written statement that they did not provide
  inside information.
      Lawyers for Samjens contended that Painewebber and Ammeen
  withdrew as potential advisers because Burlington chairman
  Frank Greenberg had called a PaineWebber executive and
  threatened legal action if PaineWebber got involved in an
  effort to takeover Burlilgnton.
      ""The ultimate question is not the price per share or the
  profit, but rather the permissable standards of conduct for
  those who would takeover an American company,"" said burlington
  lawyer Humphrey.
      Burlington lawyers also contended that Burlington, as the
  largest manufacturer of denim in the United States, would be in
  violation of anti-trust laws if it acquired Dominion, Canada's
  largest textile maker. Dominion has denim manufacturing plants
  in Georgia, which would reduce competition in the denim market,
  the lawyers said.
      Samjens' lawyers discounted the concern. They said the
  market for denim is more fragmented than Burlington contends
  and that Burlington has the ability to switch between light
  weight and heavy weight denim production as demand and price
  dictate.
      Samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed by
  Burlington in Canada, in which it said it was considering a bid
  for Dominion. ""Surely, what would have been sauce for the goose
  would have been sauce for the gander,"" said Sidney Rosdeitcher,
  a Samjens lawyer.

['interest'],"POEHL SAYS RATE RISES ARE CAUSE FOR CONCERN
  Rises in West German and international
  interest rates are a cause for concern and the Bundesbank has
  no interest in higher capital market rates, Bundesbank
  President Karl Otto Poehl said.
      ""We consider the interest rate increase that has occurred
  here and internationally to be a problem and cause for concern,""
  Poehl told an investment conference.
      ""I would like to stress that the Bundesbank has no interest
  in higher capital market rates,"" he said.
      Shortly after Poehl spoke, the Bundesbank announced a
  tender for a securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80
  pct.
      Previous tenders over the last month by interest rate have
  seen the allocation rate on these facilities rise to 3.85 pct
  at last week's pact from 3.60 on the last fixed-rate tender in
  late September.
      The Bundesbank's reduction of the key allocation rate to
  3.80 from 3.85 pct was heralded Monday by repeated injections
  of money market liquidity at between 3.70 and 3.80 pct.
      These moves to cap interest rates followed a meeting
  between Poehl, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.
  Treasury Secretary James Baker Monday in Frankfurt.
      Officials said afterwards the three men had reaffirmed
  their commitment to the Louvre accord on currency stability.
      Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of the tightening in
  West German monetary policy had prompted a sharp fall of the
  dollar on speculation that Louvre cooperation had ended.
      But the dollar rallied on news of Monday's meeting in
  nervous trading to trade above 1.79 marks Tuesday.
      Poehl said that the recent rise in interest rates was not
  due to central bank policy, but to markets' expectations, and
  currency developments.
      Commenting on the inflationary expectations, Poehl said ""You
  have to get to the root of the problem, you have to pursue a
  policy which reveals that there are no grounds for such fears.""
   The inflationary fears were unjustified and exaggerated, he
  said.
      Poehl rebuffed recent U.S. Criticism of West Germany,
  saying the Bundesbank had made a substantial contribution to
  international cooperation in interest and monetary policy.
      The Bundesbank has tolerated an overshooting of its money
  supply target, arousing criticism from other quarters, he said.
      ""Today we still have lower interest rates than at the end of
  1986... Quite the contrary of other countries, where interest
  rates have risen substantially more,"" Poehl said.
      This had to be taken into account when considering recent
  rises in repurchase pact allocation rates, which were due to
  rising international money market rates that had spilled over
  into the German market, he said.
      Poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so far
  ignored improvements in the U.S. Deficits.
      ""The adjustment process in the U.S. Trade balance is
  definitely underway,"" he said, noting that this was not so
  noticeable in absolute figures.
      The spectacular improvement in the budget deficit had also
  attracted little attention, he said.

  A new steel quota system that would

      EC industry ministers meeting here considered two key
  proposals aimed at cutting back surplus capacity by 30 mln

      The first would limit the current quota system, which has
  protected EC output for seven years, only to flat products and
  heavy sections, thereby forcing other types of steel products
  into free market competition.
      The second proposal would link continuation of a quota
  system with progress toward plant closures, although less than
  a month ago the EC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer said they
  had abandoned efforts to close plants voluntarily.
      The ministers stopped short of imposing their own solution
  immediately, instead urging steel producers to try again to

      The move is designed by the government to improve India's

  minimum annual turnover prescribed for each product.

      Output reductions by producers will take effect later this

['gold'],"NORTHGATE QUEBEC GOLD WORKERS END STRIKE
  Northgate Exploration Ltd said
  hourly-paid workers at its two Chibougamau, Quebec mines voted
  on the weekend to accept a new three-year contract offer and
  returned to work today after a one-month strike.
      It said the workers, represented by United Steelworkers of
  America, would receive a 1.21 dlr an hour pay raise over the
  life of the new contract and improved benefits.
      Northgate, which produced 23,400 ounces of gold in first
  quarter, said that while the strike slowed production, ""We are
  still looking forward to a very satisfactory performance.""
      The Chibougamau mines produced 81,500 ounces of gold last
  year.

['earn'],"ARISTECH &lt;ARS> SAYS 1ST QTR SHR ESTIMATE RIGHT
  Aristech Chemical Corp chairman and
  chief executive officer Thomas Marshall said analysts'
  estimates of its 1987 fiscal year earnings of 2.25 dlrs to 2.50
  dlrs per share are about right.
      Addressing a gathering of analysts and institutional
  investors, Marshall also said that analysts' estimates of its
  first qtr earnings - 50 cts to 55 cts per share - were ""in the
  ballpark.""
      Marshall said the full year estimates represent more than a
  32 pct increase over 1986's fiscal year net of 1.70 dlrs per
  share.
      He also said the first quarter estimates were 70 pct higher
  than 1986's first quarter net of 29 cts per share.
  Marshall attributibuted the first quarter earnings growth to
  several factors, including sustained demand in Aristech's major
  domestic markets and continued growth in exports.
      Aristech plans to spend approximately 200 mln dlrs over in
  capital investments over the next three years, Marshall added.

"['interest', 'money-fx']","BAKER SEEN WINNING GERMAN INTEREST RATES BATTLE
  The United States appears to have won a
  transatlantic battle by forcing the Bundesbank to trim interest
  rates, European economists said.
      But they added Washington set the stakes high by testing
  the limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets were
  plunging.
      West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.
  Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment to
  currency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt,
  according to official statements released late Monday.
      Only 13 hours after the statements were released, the
  Bundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banks
  liquidity at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, down from a 3.85 pct
  facility rate offered last week.
      While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbank
  president Karl Otto Poehl, the central bank had also added
  money market liquidity repeatedly, signalling it did not want a
  strong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday.
       ""It's round one to the Americans, "" said Richard Reid,
  senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew in
  London.
      But Reid added, ""We shouldn't forget that it has taken one
  of the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the West
  Germans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05
  percentage point.""
      Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of earlier tightening
  of West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall and
  fuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid.
      Six leading industrial nations agreed under February's
  Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetary
  policies. It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven -
  the US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
      The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency markets
  and the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours trading
  in New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar was
  quoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday.
      Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at Deutsche
  Genossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on world
  stock markets had been the main reason for the fall in West
  German short-term interest rates on Tuesday.
      ""The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock market
  losses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fits
  with Baker's wishes, then all the better,"" he said.
      No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and the
  Bundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following rises
  in the U.S., Aschoff said.
      Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the central
  bank has no interest in higher capital market rates and he
  thought the global rate increase was a cause for concern.
      Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First Boston
  Ltd in London said ""The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreat
  and Baker has won a battle...But he hasn't won the war as the
  security repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it was
  before the IMF meeting last month in Washington.""
      Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord was
  reaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidity
  at 3.60 pct, Keating noted.
      Economists said the United States now appeared to have
  agreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and support
  the dollar in return for the German action on interest rates.
      Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinder
  Washington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Stoltenberg
  told a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not rule
  out central banks of leading industrial countries intervening
  on exchange markets to defend the dollar's value.
      Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed West
  Germany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency
  stability. In addition, both the U.S. And West German central
  banks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force them
  to again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar.

      Sales for the next marketing year, which begins September
  1, totaled 503,200 tonnes and were mainly to Iraq and Taiwan.
      Wheat sales of 119,300 tonnes for the current season and
  net reductions of 13,700 tonnes for the 1987/88 season were
  four-fifths below the combined total for the prior week and the

      Sri Lanka was the most active wheat destination with

      Other significant purchasers for the current year were
  Mexico and Honduras, it said.
      Soybean sales of 240,500 tonnes were one-fifth below the

  reductions for unknown destinations, USDA said.
      Activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of 2,400

  tonnes, while sales to Canada increased 200 tonnes, the
  Department said.
      Combined sales of 71,300 running bales of cotton -- 60,200

['trade'],"BRITISH MINISTER SAYS HE WARNED TOKYO OF SANCTIONS
  A British minister said he had given the
  Japanese government a clear warning of sanctions against
  Japanese companies if Tokyo did not allow more access to its
  internal markets ""and it was clearly understood.""
      Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard said on his
  return from a visit to Japan he thought the Japanese were
  beginning to appreciate the need to be ""fair and open"" about
  access to their own markets.
      At an airport news conference Howard denied opposition
  charges that his trip had been a failure because he had
  returned empty-handed.
      ""I did what I set out to do. I was sent to deliver a clear
  message to the Japanese government, and I delivered it very
  clearly, and it has been clearly understood.""
      Howard said that under the Financial Services Act the
  govenment had considerable flexibility in taking sanctions
  against Japanese companies and finance houses operating in
  Britain.
      ""It is not simply a question of withdrawing or refusing
  operating licences. We can ban firms from certain countries
  from carrying out certain kinds of business, while allowing
  them to carry out other kinds.""
      ""I hope we don't have to use these powers, but I made it
  clear in Japan that if our timetable isn't met, we shall use
  them.""
      He said it would be unfortunate if Britain and Japan became
  involved in a tit-for-tat exchange, adding that Japan gained
  more than anyone else from an open trading relationship.
      ""I think they are beginning to appreciate that if this
  relationship is to continue, it is very important for them to
  be fair and open about access to their own markets.""
      On the question of the British firm Cable and Wireless Plc
  &lt;CAWL.L>, which is trying to win a significant share of
  telecommunications contracts in Japan, Howard said he had told
  the Japanese this was being widely regarded as a test case.
      He said there were signs of movement on the case. Cable and
  Wireless was due to take part in talks in Japan next Tuesday,
  he said.
      Earlier this week British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
  said Britain could not go it alone on sanctions against Japan,
  but would have to coordinate action with its European Community
  partners.
      Community sources said after a meeting of trade officials
  yesterday that the group might impose steep new tariffs on a
  range of Japanese goods to prevent diversion from United States

"['dlr', 'money-fx']","BAKER/STOLTENBERG MEETING SOOTHES MARKETS
  News of a meeting between U.S. Treasury
  Secretary James Baker and West German Finance Minister Gerhard
  Stoltenberg on Monday soothed currency markets, allowing the
  dollar to recoup much of the day's losses, dealers said.
      News of the meeting, which took place in Frankfurt in great
  secrecy, came after the dollar fell sharply on criticism by
  Baker of West German monetary policy, which had provoked fears
  that the Louvre pact on currency stability was in jeopardy.
      The dollar reacted immediately to the news, rising over two
  pfennigs in after hours New York trading, dealers there said.
      The announcement of the meeting, also attended by
  Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, was made simultaneously
  in Bonn and Washington, timed for after the closure of New York
  markets.
      Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl agreed to pursue the policies
  accepted under the February Louvre accord, a finance ministry
  spokesman in Bonn said.
      The dollar rose to 1.7970/90 marks from New York's close of
  1.7730/40. It had closed there on Friday at 1.7975/85 marks.
      The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the market
  reacted to Baker's criticism of rising West German interest
  rates, and stock markets crashed worldwide. Baker had said that
  West Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord.
      Under the accord, leading industrial democracies pledged to
  coordinate economic policies to foster currency stability, with
  the surplus countries, West Germany and Japan, stimulating
  their economies and the U.S. promising to cut its budget
  deficit.
      West German government sources said rising West German
  money market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvre
  pact. They were rather a direct reaction to higher interest
  rates in the United States. U.S. Bond yields have been rising
  since May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fed
  raised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50.
      German yields have also risen over this period, but less
  markedly, and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged up
  short-term rates by changing the terms on its security
  repurchase pacts, its principal instrument for steering the
  money market.
      The allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct,
  compared with 3.60 pct. This was partly due to West Germany's
  inability to uncouple itself from U.S. interest rate trends,
  but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in the
  Bundesbank central bank council about excessive monetary
  growth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation,
  bank economists said.
      This monetary tightening reflected a switch from the
  pragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl
  since early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to the
  more cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger.
      In an apparent gesture to Baker, coinciding with his visit,
  the Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity this
  morning. Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease U.S.
  anger over the most recent West German interest rate rises.
      ""They (the Bundesbank) just don't want to come too much
  under American fire,"" said Chris Zwermann, currency adviser at
  Swiss Bank Corp here.
      ""It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite a
  significant retreat from its position,"" added Giles Keating,
  economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London.
      The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms of
  the Bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pact
  on Tuesday, and its result on Wednesday, money market
  economists said.
      Today's injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbank
  does not want a further strong rise in the tender allocation
  rate, which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct,
  little changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility.
      The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indication
  that the meeting would take place, although the Finance
  Ministry spokesman said it had been arranged last week.
      Earlier on Monday the Finance Ministry spokesman, asked to
  comment on the apparent U.S.-German clash over the Louvre
  accord, went no further than quoting Stoltenberg as saying he
  assumed monetary cooperation would continue.
      The spokesman said he believed Baker had already left West
  Germany for Sweden on Monday. This week he is also due to visit
  Denmark and Belgium.

  Petroleum Corp (CEPE) said.
      CEPE manager Carlos Romoleroux told reporters that Ecuador
  would begin pumping an unspecified amount of crude in
  northeastern jungle oilfields at the end of next week in
  preparation to send the oil through a new pipeline link-up to
  neighbouring Colombia.
      Oil production in Ecuador was halted on March five when an
  earthquake damaged the country's main pipeline from Lago Agrio,
  at the heart of the Ecuadorean jungle oilfields, to the pacific
  port of Balao.
      It will take at least until the end of July to repair the
  pipeline and return output to normal levels. The country was
  pumping between 245,000 bpd and 250,000 bpd before the tremor.
      To resume limited output in the meantime, Ecuador is
  constructing a 26 mile pipeline linkup, capable of carrying
  55,000 bpd, from Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon, the starting point
  of Colombia's pipeline to the Pacific port of Tumaco.
      The original target date to resume limited crude output was
  May eight, the scheduled date for the inauguration of the Lago
  Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline, an energy ministry spokesman
  said.

"['dlr', 'interest', 'money-fx']","ANALYSTS DOUBT FED FIRMED DESPITE BORROWING RISE
  Economists said that they doubt the
  Federal Reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar, despite
  higher discount window borrowings in the latest two-week
  statement period and very heavy borrowings Wednesday.
      Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged
  393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday, up from 265 mln
  dlrs in the prior statement period. Wednesday borrowings were
  1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct.
      ""One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but it
  probably isn't,"" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds.
      Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policy
  modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the
  two-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging
  around 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months.
      However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latest
  two-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand
  often pushes up borrrowings.
      ""Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but it
  looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions
  late in the statement period and didn't quite make it,"" said
  Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
      A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today that
  the Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs or
  more in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday.
      Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in
  its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer
  reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed.
      The Fed took no market reserve management action last
  Thursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It added
  temporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs of
  customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves
  directly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday.
      Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that the
  two-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged on
  Tuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday's
  overnight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.
      ""It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy at
  this time,"" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.
      Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzi
  said the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest
  rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak
  economies in the United States and abroad and add to the
  financial stress of developing countries and their lenders.
      ""Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the latest
  statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar
  tumbled,"" said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch.
      He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new
  statement period began today on disappointment yesterday's
  Washington meetings of international monetary officials failed
  to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.
      In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing in
  Wednesday's G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view that
  the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade
  imbalance between the United States and Japan.
      The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming for
  steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average
  Fed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about where
  the rate has been since early November.
      ""I'm not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighter
  policy to help the dollar, as some suspect,"" said Sullivan of
  Dean Witter.
      If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has just
  nudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct from
  six to 6.10 pct previously.

['coffee'],"U.S. COFFEE IMPORT REPORTING SYSTEM QUESTIONED
  A voluntary compliance system for
  monitoring U.S. coffee imports under quotas is viewed
  skeptically by many in the coffee industry, said analysts and
  trade sources.
      ""Many sectors of the trade, including large roasters and 
  importers, are adamant against voluntary compliance because of
  the past, which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it
  became a matter of the trade monitoring each other,"" one
  analyst said.
      On Monday, a National Coffee Association newsletter said
  the Office of U.S. Trade Representative will implement a
  voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to
  monitor imports is tied up in the Congressional trade bill.
      Under the arrangement, milar to one in 1980, coffee
  importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the
  U.S. government until Congress approves the monitoring
  authority, but if coffee arrives without valid certification,
  it will still be allowed entry.
      While many believe producers will not seek to add to the
  overburdened stock situation in the U.S., others believe some
  will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of
  monitoring controls, trade sources said.
      ""Last time, there was a lot of false information submitted
  to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines,"" a
  U.S. Customs spokesman said.
      ""Customs can do a good job when given the tools, but when
  its hands are tied, it doesn't have the authority to demand
  Form O (documents tracking merchandise from source to
  destination),"" he said.
      Many see it as a true test of whether producers and
  importers will abide by the quota system.
      ""It is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the
  quota agreement,"" said one major U.S. roaster.
       ""Last time we had a gentleman's agreement, the trade did
  not act as a gentleman,"" said another analyst adding, ""without
  the need to submit documents, the ball will be in the
  producers' hands.""
      Some feel that importers will take advantage of the
  voluntary compliance due to development of a two-tier market,
  in which non-member countries buy coffee at a big discount.
  Many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non-member
  countries at discounts and then bring it into the U.S. falsely
  labelled.
      According to customs officials, several green coffee
  importers confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee
  fraudulently after buying it for non-member destinations,
  forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy
  beans.
      ""If there's that much of a discrepancy between prices for
  one country and another, producers may be teted to get rid of
  their stocks of coffee by selling to non-member nations and by
  circumventing the quota provisions,"" said Paine Webber analyst
  Bernie Savaiko.
      Still, others believe that producers will not be hard
  pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in
  the U.S. in the near term.
      ""It would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not
  have some share of connivance, but I think the voluntary system
  seemed to suffice and, coupled with the fact that we have so
  much coffee, I don't think that it poses that much of a
  threat,"" one trader said.

      Such a renunciation would be the first step to imposing

  said.
      The plan is being developed in conjunction with the ECGD

      Neither the ECGD nor the Bank of England would comment on
  the plan. However, bankers said one of the main points under
  discussion is a plan to refinance the bulk of the ECGD's medium
  term credit portfolio in the international capital markets.
  
      The proposals involve introducing a set of interest margins
  on ECGD backed debt of 5/16 to 7/8 pct, depending on the size
  and maturity of the credit and the currency.
      The banks are likely to push for a higher margin. Bankers

  would still be more than those proposed about a year ago when

      ""There might have been some isolated storms, but certainly
  nothing damaging,"" said Charles Stichler, an extension
  agronomist with the Agricultural Extension Service in far West

      Rumors of a damaging storm in West Texas helped the New

      Lubbock is the heart of the West Texas cotton region, which
  produces about 80 pct of that state's crop.
      The storm produced winds of about 75 mph. ""That's hurricane

['gnp'],"U.S. ECONOMY SLOWDOWN RAISES RECESSION FEARS
  The economy faces lackluster growth
  and the risk of recession this year if the recent improvement
  in U.S. exports should falter, economists say.
      Growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weakness
  in the key housing and auto sectors and could be further
  hampered unless consumer spending picks up, they say.
      ""These factors raise the question: Is there enough strength
  to keep the economy from tipping into a recession?"" said Lyle
  Gramley, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers
  Association and a former Federal Reserve Board official.
      The Commerce Department said this week that the economy
  grew by a robust 4.8 pct annual rate in the first quarter, but
  a U.S. monetary official called it a weak report.
      Housing starts fell 2.7 pct in May, and consumer spending
  rose a weak 0.1 per cent.
      ""Our two largest visible industries -- autos and housing --
  are faltering, but exports are picking up some of the slack, ""
  Martin Mauro, senior economist for Merrill Lynch Economics,
  told Reuters.
      Gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slow
  because inflation is rising faster than real wages.
      To offset this, U.S. exports must continue to rise,
  returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boost
  personal income and consumption, he says.
      ""I expect to see enough improvement in real net exports to
  keep a recession from happening, but it is a close call,""
  Gramley said.
      Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger told reporters
  that the apparent strength in the 4.8 pct growth figure was the
  result of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not last
  and said the recovery was showing anemia.
      Seger said that with the recovery stumbling along, ""The pace
  of the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored into
  monetary policy"" - possibly a signal that the Fed will be
  accommodative.
      Most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pct
  forecast by the Reagan administration for 1987 and warn that if
  the dollar drops suddenly, higher inflation will result and add
  to the risk of a recession.
      Mauro said a 0.5 pct rise in industrial production in May
  came despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry, where an
  inventory overhang still exists.
      He says the boost in production came from smaller
  industries like paper, chemicals, and lumber which have
  improved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar.
      ""They are not going to be enough for any kind of surge in
  economic activity, but I think they will keep us out of a
  recession,"" Mauro said.
      In a speech to financial planners this week, Beryl
  Sprinkel, the chief White House economic adviser, predicted the
  trade deficit will continue to improve.
      ""Prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 and
  into 1988 are still quite favorable,"" he said.
      But private economists raise concerns about a resurgence in
  inflation.
      Allen Sinai, chief economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers
  Inc., told Congress this week that inflation would rise to 4.5
  to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 after
  a 1.1 pct increase in 1986.
      The rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar, higher oil
  and energy prices and rising prices for services, he said.
      ""The lesson of history is that once the inflation genie gets
  out of the bottle, it continues to persist,"" he said, adding he
  would like the Fed to tighten credit.
      A major factor affecting inflation is the value of the
  dollar, which should continue to fall and feed inflation, says
  a prominent international banker.
      Rainer Gut, chairman of Credit Suisse, told the National
  Press Club that the dollar's downward trend against the yen and
  the mark will continue for years because the United States is
  the world's largest debtor nation.
      The Swiss banker said the economic indicators point to a
  further slackening of activity and called naive the belief that
  the five-year boom on world equity markets will go on forever.
  ""It is very difficult to be optimistic,"" Gut said.

  Cominco Ltd said it set
  tentative talks with three striking union locals that rejected
  on Saturday a three-year contract offer at Cominco's Trail and
  Kimberley, British Columbia lead-zinc operations.
      The locals, part of United Steelworkers of America,
  represent 2,600 production and maintenance workers. No date has
  been set for the talks, the spokesman replied to a query.
      The spokesman said talks were still ongoing with the two

  workers. Production at Trail and Kimberley has been shut down
  since the strike started May 9.
      Each of the five locals has a separate contract that
  expired April 30, but the main issues are similar.
      The Trail smelter produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and
  110,000 long tons of lead last year, while the Sullivan mine at
  Kimberley produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year, most for
  processing at Trail.
      Revenues from Trail's smelter totaled 356 mln Canadian dlrs

  Venezuela will back Ecuador's bid to

  because it is a justifiable demand, Venezuelan Energy Minister
  Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said on Monday.
      He told reporters the country deserved a higher quota in
  compensation for the five months it was forced to suspend oil
  production when its main pipeline was destroyed by an
  earthquake last March.
      ""For this five-month period, Ecuador did not exercise its
  right to produce 221,000 bpd,"" he said. ""We should recognize
  Ecuador's right to increase its quota ... There is a basis of
  justice in that country's petition.""
      He added however, the quota increase should be gradual to
  avoid harming the market, he added.
      Hernandez Grisanti said he understood Ecuador would
  formally submit the request for a higher quota at the next

"
['acq'],"COMPUTER ASSOC. &lt;CA> BOLSTERS HAND AGAINST IBM
  Computer Associates International Inc's
  800 mln dlr merger with Uccel Corp &lt;UCE> will eliminate its
  strongest rival, but the company still faces stiff competition
  from International Business Machines Corp &lt;IBM>, Wall Street
  analysts said.
       ""IBM is still the ruling force in mainframe systems
  software,"" said Scott Smith, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin
  and Jenrette.
      ""But the combination of the two companies will clearly
  present a much stronger front,"" he said.
      Besides IBM, ""Computer Associates will be far and away the
  most powerful company in the field,"" added E.F. Hutton analyst
  Terence Quinn.
      That field is a segment of the market known as system
  utilities, or software packages that boost the productivity of
  a company's data processing facilities by increasing the speed,
  power and efficiency of large mainframe computers.
      The merger of Uccel and Computer Associates combines the
  two biggest systems utilities suppliers other than IBM.
  Analysts said the remaining players are mostly small firms that
  will find the competition much harder than in the past.
      For Computer Associates, the merger with Uccel caps a
  six-year acquisition campaign that has vaulted the Garden City,
  N.Y.-based company to the top of the software industry.
      When the deal is completed sometime in August, the
  company's revenues will exceed 450 mln dlrs, pushing it past 
  Microsoft Corp &lt;MFST> as the world's largest independent
  software vendor.
      Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles B. Wang
  took the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought
  15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3
  mln dlrs for the year ended March 31.
      Liemandt took charge of Wyly, sold off its non-computer
  businesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframe
  computer software. In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp.
      Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after the
  merger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth.
      On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of six
  companies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs.
      For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, on
  sales of 141.5 mln dlrs.
      The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largely
  because the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also,
  Dallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from the
  dark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or
  56 cts a share.
     At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 different
  businesses, only three of which were involved in computer
  software. In 1983, Walter Haefner, a Swiss financier and a
  major Wyly investor, lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from his
  job as chairman of General Electric Co's &lt;GE> computer services
  unit.
      Computer Associates' Wang and Uccel's Liemandt said at a
  news conference that the merger would give computer users a
  single source for a wide range of software products.
      In addition to system utilities, Computer Associates also
  sell products for microcomputers, while Uccel has made inroads
  in the applications software market, where analysts said it has
  been successful with accounting and banking systems.
      Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support and
  enhance both companies' product lines, but noted that the
  company will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He said
  about 20 pct of the companies' products overlap.
      Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings of
  current Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. But
  they joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not dilute
  Computer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year.
      Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record of
  completing acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore,
  he said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05
  dlrs a share.
      Wang said he would look closely at the combined operations
  of the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketing
  and research and development.
      Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel.
  Based on Friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50
  dlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly
  33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share.
      Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said most
  software companies are currently valued at about 20 times
  per-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth the
  premium because of its earnings potential and customer base.
  
      Wang said Haefner, the Swiss investor, would hold about 25
  pct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currently
  owns 58 pct of Uccel.
      The executive said the merger would not alter his target of
  maintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct.
      In addition, he said he expects no problems in having the
  deal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. Justice
  Department.
      Uccel's Liemandt declined to say what he will do after the
  merger, but he did not rule out working together with Wang.
