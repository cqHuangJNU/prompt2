  A 50 pct cut in the import tariff for

      He said the cut to 3.5 from seven pct was approved by the

['tin'],"THAI SMELTER FACES TIN CONCENTRATE SUPPLY SHORTAGE
  Thailand's major tin exporter and
  producer &lt;Thailand Smelting and Refining Co> (Thaisarco) said
  it may be unable to meet all its overseas orders because of
  insufficient supplies of tin concentrates from Thai mines.
      Local mines cut combined daily tin concentrate sales to
  Thaisarco, a Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD.AS> unit, to less than
  20 tonnes earlier this month from a previous 40 to 45 tonne
  average, commercial manager Yoot Eamsa-ard told Reuters.
      He said the cuts resulted from a government decision to let
  the temporary business and municipal tax reductions on exported
  tin lapse on June 3.
      The taxes, levied on the tin mines, rose to 4.4 pct this
  month from 1.1 pct ad valorem over the past year. The lower
  levels had been introduced last year as a temporary move to aid
  the tin industry after prices collapsed in late 1985.
      Yoot said Thaisarco had to dig into its stocks to meet a
  large portion of new overseas orders which were averaging 100
  tonnes per day.
      As a result, he said, Thailand could fail to fill some
  3,000 tonnes of its 19,000 tonne tin export quota allocated by
  the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) for the year
  ending February 1988.
      Reduced tin exports this year could cause the ATPC to
  allocate a lower quota next year, Yoot said.
      The supplies shortage should prove temporary, however,
  because the Thai cabinet is expected to review a Mineral
  Resources Department proposal to reinstate the low taxes late
  this month, Yoot said.
      The department said Thailand exported 7,715 tonnes of tin
  during January/May compared with 8,462 tonnes a year ago.

  Fiji sugar farmers will receive an interim
  payment on the 1986 crop, four months ahead of schedule, in a
  move aimed at getting harvesting of the drought-hit 1987 crop
  under way, Governor-general Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau said.
      Industry sources said latest forecasts for the 1987 crop
  indicated output of 360,000 tonnes, well down on the record
  501,800 tonne tel quel production in the 1986 (May-December)
  crop year.
      The previous record was set in 1982 when Fiji produced
  486,790 tonnes.
      For the past month Fiji sugar farmers have delayed
  harvesting the 1987 crop pending a response from the
  Governor-general to demands following the May 14 coup.
      Ganilau said in a statement the Fiji Sugar Corp would make
  a payment of five dlrs per tonne against the final payment for
  the 1986 crop on the understanding that preparations by growers
  for commencement of harvesting would be completed at all mills
  by June 23.
      Crushing would commence at Labasa and Penang mills on June
  23 and at Lautoka and Rarawai mills on June 30, he said.
      The interim payment, to be made on or about June 30, is the
  full amount of the grower's share of 1986 sugar proceeds
  received to-date. The balance will be paid in October.
      Growers had also called for the full 1987 forecast price of
  23.50 dlrs per tonne of cane to be paid in cash on delivery to
  the mill, but this has been rejected by the state controlled
  Fiji Sugar Corp, Ganilau said.
      However, in addition to the scheduled delivery payment of
  14.10 dlrs, an additional sum of 2.35 dlrs, or 10 pct of the
  forecast price, would be paid on December 15, on all cane
  harvested by November 30, he said.
      Ganilau said, ""This will be at least one month in advance of
  the expected date of payment of the second payment of cane. The
  balance of the second payment will be made six weeks after the
  end of crushing.""
      Another demand of Fiji's 22,000 small farmers was that an
  estimated 14 mln dlr loan from the Fiji Development Bank (FDB)
  for the 1983 cane crop rehabilitation programme be written off.
  The FDB rejected this request.
      Ganilau said, however, ""The bank is prepared to carefully
  consider requests for rescheduling loan repayments in cases of
  hardship on a case-by-case basis.""
      In response to a further demand that all soldiers be
  removed from the cane growing areas, Ganilau said the army
  would restrict its presence in the cane areas.
      He said he had directed the authorities to issue permits to
  harvesting gangs, cane growers and sugar industry trade unions
  to hold the necessary meetings in preparation for the
  commencement of harvest.
      Senior representatives of the sugar cane growers had
  indicated a desire to commence the crush as soon as possible,
  he added.

"['grain', 'wheat']","AWB CHAIRMAN URGES FARMERS NOT TO CUT PLANTINGS
  Australia could lose valuable wheat
  markets through lack of availability if plantings for the
  coming 1987/88 season are significantly reduced, Australian
  Wheat Board (AWB) chairman Clinton Condon said.
      ""If predictions of a 30 pct decrease in plantings prove
  true, Australia may not be able to supply wheat to some of its
  valuable markets,"" he said in a statement.
      Condon did not say who had made the predictions, but an AWB
  spokesman said there was a general industry feeling that
  farmers, hard hit by low prices and rising costs, could cut
  back plantings sharply. Wheat sowing normally begins in May.
      However, Condon said he did not believe plantings would be
  cut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers were
  facing enormous financial pressures.
      He said the AWB expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mln
  hectares, down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about
  16 mln tonnes. Final crop estimates for 1986/87 and planting
  intentions for 1987/88 are not yet available.
      If the AWB is unable, because of a short-term cut in
  plantings, to meet the needs of the markets it has developed
  with much time and effort, it may have great difficulty selling
  wheat to those markets in the future, Condon said.
      ""Markets which rely on a steady supply of Australian wheat
  understand a decrease in production due to drought but they
  will have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision to
  decrease production,"" Condon said.
      ""If Australia wants wheat to continue as a major export
  income earner, governments and government authorities will need
  to closely examine ways of contributing to the continuing
  viability of the wheat industry,"" he added.

"['gnp', 'interest']","NO REASON TO CUT RATES - BUNDESBANK'S SCHLESINGER
  Bundesbank vice president Helmut
  Schlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now.
      With money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down in
  May and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark,
  Schlesinger told Reuters that he was not convinced that a
  further cut in interest rates was needed.
      The economy is picking up, after contracting by a
  seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter from
  the fourth, he added. ""We may have an increase in gnp starting
  in the second quarter,"" he said in an interview.
      Concerned by the first quarter downturn, the U.S. Has been
  pressing West Germany to pump up its economy and boost its
  imports, either through fiscal or monetary policy.
      Schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter was
  mainly due to adverse weather conditions, just as occured in
  1986. Year-on-year growth was thus about two pct.
      He estimated that economic growth for the year as a whole
  would probably be between one and two pct.
     ""It is not a question of monetary conditions if domestic
  demand does not grow strongly,"" he said, noting that interest
  rates are at historically low levels and funds are ample.
      Schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money
  stock growth was slowing down from its recent year-on-year pace
  of 7-1/2 to eight pct, well above the Bundesbank's three to six
  pct target.
      He said the target could still be achieved but much will
  depend on the direction of long-term capital flows. Heavy
  inflows, particularly in January around the time of the EMS
  revaluation, boosted domestic money supply.
      ""There is still a certain hope that the net inflow of
  foreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bit
  reversed,"" Schlesinger said.
      A major reason for the inflows was the market's conviction
  that the mark was headed higher. ""As we can see from the market,
  expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark have
  diminished,"" Schlesinger said.
      The recent widening of interest rate differentials, the
  fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short period
  and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined
  towards stabilizing the dollar, he said.
      Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollar
  rise, as the U.S. Did in March when the dollar rose above 1.87
  marks, he said this would depend on the circumstances.
      At midday here, the dollar stood at 1.8340/45 marks.
      ""Central banks are always in contact about these
  fluctuations but I cannot give any answer how they would react,""
  Schelsinger said.
      ""One has to look at how it (the market) is moving,"" he said,
  adding, ""It is not only our own case, it is also the American
  case.""
      He said that the West German export industry has been hit
  hard by the dollar's sharp fall and would probably like to see
  some correction now. ""But it wouldn't be good to have short-term
  fluctuations,"" he said. ""Let us wait and see.""
      ""It is mainly the strength of the (dollar) fall in a very
  short period which was a little bit of a shock, than the level
  (of rates) as such,"" Schlesinger said.
      The sharp rise of the mark, coupled with weak prices of
  such key commodities as oil, had a favourable impact on West
  German inflation down year.
      Although there have recently been signs of inflation
  picking up, he said that this was due to changes in key
  commodity prices. The underlying inflation rate this year would
  be unchanged, at about one to 1-1/2 pct, he said.
      Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth
  was longer term, in that the economy was building up the
  potential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation.
      The above-target growth of money supply over the past 16
  months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness of
  targets themselves, a matter which might be taken up at the
  mid-year meeting of the Bundesbank's council, Schlesigner said.
      But he added: ""I don't see any great pressure to go away
  from it.""

      Last year, General Tire had operating profits of 79 mln
  dlrs on sales of 1.1 billion dlrs, and Gencorp had operating
  profits of 130 mln dlrs on sales of 3.1 billion dlrs.
      GenCorp spokesman Rip Tilden said the company will retain
  about 100 mln dlrs in liability for its former General Tire
  employees under the agreement.
      Tilden said Gencorp will use the proceeds from the sale to
  reduce its 1.5 billion dlr debt.
      In April, GenCorp sucessfully thwarted a takeover by a
  partnership formed by AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG> and Wagner and
  Brown with a restructuring program that included the purchase
  of up to 54 pct, or 12.5 mln shares, of its common at 130 dlrs
  a share for a total of 1.6 billion dlrs
      As part of the restructuring, GenCorp also said it planned
  to sell its tire business, the bottling operations of its RKO
  General Inc subsidiary, and RKO's remaining broadcast
  properties to focus on the company's aerospace and automotive
  components businesses.
     
      Tilden said Gencorp expects to realize about 850 mln dlrs
  in after tax proceeds by the end of 1987 as a result of sale of
  several pieces of the nonbroadcast assets of the company,
  including general tire.
      ""The price paid for General tire would not cause us to
  reevaluate that estimate,"" said Tilden.
      General Tire employs 10,000 people worldwide and has four
  tire manufacturing plants in the U.S. and one in Canada.
      In a statemnet, A. William Reynolds, GenCorp chairman said
  the sale of General Tire ""represents a critical accomplishment
  in our plan to restructure GenCorp.""
     
      Reynolds also said GenCorp's previously announced sale of
  its other businesses are ""proceeding satisfactorily.""
      Among the pieces of Gencorp's empire that remain to be sold
  are its RKO bottling operations. GenCorp agreed to sell RKO's
  KHJ-TV station to Walt Disney Co &lt;DIS> for
  217 mln dlrs. That deal awaits approval by the Federal
  Communications Commission. GenCorp also received 257 dlrs after
  tax from the sale of RKO's WOR-TV.

  The House Agriculture Committee voted
  to make approximately 2.8 billion dlrs of feedgrains deficiency
  payments immediately instead of in the late fall.
      A similar measure was decisively defeated on the Senate
  floor last week.
      The bill, which passed by a voice vote, would allow
  so-called Findley payments to be made immediately rather than
  late this year. Payments for 1987-90 feedgrains crops would not
  be changed.
      Because the bill would move 2.8 billion dlrs of spending

['interest'],"UPTREND REMAINS INTACT FOR DEBT FUTURES
  The six basis point rise of the past
  month in U.S. debt futures may be extended next week by a
  series of U.S. economic reports, analysts said, as long as the
  dollar holds firm.
      ""Interest rates have declined by approximately 50 basis
  points over the last month, largely over indications that
  inflation is not as high as people had feared and the narrowing
  U.S. trade balance, in nominal terms,"" Samuel Kahan, chief
  financial economist with Kleinwort Benson Government
  Securities, said.
      Kahan said recent government reports have shown strength in
  the economy during the first quarter, but his concern is
  whether the U.S. economy will sustain that strength in the
  longer term.
      Weak U.S. economic growth could hurt the dollar, which has
  become more important to the direction of debt futures than the
  beneficial impact on interest rates of a sluggish economy.
      The median trade expectations for Tuesday's U.S. Consumer
  Price Index and Durable Goods reports are up 0.4 pct and down
  1.5 pct, respectively.
      Meanwhile, the eight billion dlr drop in the M-1 money
  supply announced this week was ""surprising, much larger than
  expected,"" according to Kahan. ""Unless quickly reversed,"" such
  a trend ""will ensure that June M-1 growth will be negative,""
  Kahan said.
      Taken in conjunction with M-2 and M-3 aggregates which
  Kahan said have ""slowed to a crawl, below Federal Reserve Board
  annual targets,"" the consequences could be a hint of economic
  weakness down the road, he said.
      Based on chart formations, T-bond futures may be poised for
  further gains, although the advance has been slowed recently,
  analysts said.
      September T-bonds ""are up almost six points since about May
  18,"" Merrill Lynch debt analyst Jim Duggan noted. September
  bond futures climbed from the low of 87 a month ago to over 93
  in mid-June, Duggan said.
      While follow-through buying has aided the advance so far,
  and bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide through
  chart support, the rally in September T-bonds has been thwarted
  above the 93 level.
      ""The 93 level is formidable resistance and must be taken
  out before this activity is anything other than a trading range
  market,"" Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures debt analyst
  Brian Singer said.
      The dollar remains the key fundamental factor, and the U.S.
  currency has made little headway of late, analysts said.
      ""The critical variable remaining in the market is the value
  of the dollar,"" Kahan said.
      Additional influences next week will be possible
  developments ahead of an OPEC members meeting, and the impact
  and size of the U.S. budget deficit, ""although these will not
  be in the forefront of the market early next week,"" Kahan said.
      In looking ahead to the U.S. Treasury mini-refunding
  auctions of 24.25 billion in T-notes on Tuesday, Wednesday and
  Thursday, Singer said the market will likely greet the results
  with little excitement. However, a successful auction could
  prove to be a turning point, depending on prevailing market
  psychology.

  trying to do is to get the other major industrial nations that
  are involved to bring interest rates down, say, one pct,""
  Bentsen told NBC Television's ""Meet the Press.""
      Bentsen said coordinated rate cuts could take ""billions off
  the debt service of the Latin countries"" and help ease

      Bentsen also South Korea and Taiwan should be pressured to
  revalue their currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar.
      ""You take the Taiwanese, with an enormous capital surplus,
  enormous trade surplus, and we've had very little cooperation
  there,"" he said.

  same television network he agreed that the U.S. dollar had not
  fallen enough against the currencies of some countries.
      ""I think that more does have to be done there in

['money-fx'],"TAIWAN CURBS INFLOWS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE
  Taiwan's central bank announced that as
  from today the overseas foreign exchange borrowings of local
  and foreign banks would be frozen at the level they reached at
  the end of May.
      The central bank's statement added that the measure would
  be effective until the end of July.
      Bankers said the measure is designed to curb the inflow of
  foreign exchange and slow the growth of money supply. They
  added that the move, which sparked a record single day plunge
  of the local stock market, would limit their ability to lend
  foreign exchange to importers and exporters.
      Foreign exchange borrowings by local and foreign banks
  reached almost 12 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of April,
  according to official statistics.
      Last week the central bank said that from today it would
  reduce its purchase of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40
  pct from 90 pct of the value of the contract. It said the move
  was needed because of ""distortions"" in the foreign exchange
  market.
      Exporters, nervous about the appreciating Taiwan dollar,
  have been heavily selling forward U.S. Dollars on the interbank
  market to avoid exchange rate losses.
      Official figures show that forward U.S. Dollar sales in May
  reached a record of almost six billion U.S. Dlrs against 5.9
  billion in April.
      All Taiwan's foreign exchange earnings must be converted
  into local dollars, boosting money supply at a time of booming
  exports. Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.86 pct in
  the year to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation.
      In March the central bank clamped tight restrictions on
  remittances of foreign exchange by companies and individuals to
  Taiwan in a move to curb inflows of speculative money.
      Economists and bankers estimate that the rising value of
  the local dollar has attracted about ten billion U.S. Dlrs of
  speculative money into Taiwan since early last year. It has
  flowed in mainly from Hong Kong, Japan and the U.S..
      Since September 1985 the Taiwan dollar has risen by about
  22 pct against the U.S. Dollar.
      Bankers said the government's efforts to stabilise the
  foreign exchange market were a prelude to lifting all curbs on
  capital outflows. The central bank has said the controls will
  be dropped by the end of July or early August.
      Foreign exchange dealers said today's announcement caused
  jitters in the market with foreign and local banks making heavy
  purchases of U.S. Dollars. They said the central bank sold
  about 30 mln U.S. Dlrs.
      Taiwan's stock market plunged a record 75.53 points to
  close at 1,803.08.

"
['trade'],"DEFICIT CUTS SEEN UNABLE TO CURE TRADE DEFICIT
  Financial analysts say they are
  pleased with congressional moves to trim next year's federal
  budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help
  improve the U.S. trade deficit or buoy the economy.
      The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrow
  to approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the coming
  fiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs.
      Similarly, the Senate Budget Committee has approved a plan
  that would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next
  year.
          ""In terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs is
  infinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have little
  impact on the economy and the trade deficit,"" said Stanley
  Collander, a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst.
      ""At best, it will have a small positive effect,"" Collander
  said in an interview.
      Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedly
  told Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way
  to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease
  some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar.
      The U.S. government has attempted to remedy the trade
  imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. But Volcker
  has warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraught
  with danger.
      Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as
  imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign
  capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.
      In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other
  major industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of
  the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates
  should be stabilized at around current levels.
      As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to
  take steps to stimulate their economies and the United States
  agreed to cut its budget deficit.
      The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a
  way to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is
  to reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.
      ""If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything else
  you do is going to be counterproductive,"" Volcker said in recent
  testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.
      Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the
  government's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit
  supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or
  to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United
  States.
      Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the
  current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.
      Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed
  that any deficit reduction was better than none.
      But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were 
  not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it
  needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar
  from plunging further in world exchange markets.
      ""There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if
  your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the
  Fed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer
  is, it's not enough,"" Silvia told Reuters.
      The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government's
  most vexing and persistent problems.
      The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet
  little indication that this year's figure will be any lower,
  though administration officials have predicted it will drop by
  about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end.
      In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep
  worrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the
  federal budget.
      On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not
  attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for
  the 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balanced
  budget law.
      While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for
  next year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget
  Committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall
  short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.
      ""For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the
  most you're going to get"" out of Congress at the present time,
  said Touche Ross's Collander. ""To do something more than that
  would be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult.""
      Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up
  short of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.
      ""To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable
  reduction level,"" he explained. ""Anything less than that will now
  look like a failure to Wall Street.""
      The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would
  lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year
  beginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting
  defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their
  anticipated spending levels for next year.
      The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of
  nearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new 
  taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts.

"['crude', 'ship']","CHANCES OF DIRECT U.S.-IRAN GULF CLASH SEEN LOW
  U.S. moves to increase its warships in
  and around the Mideast Gulf could trigger more attacks on
  unprotected merchant ships but run little risk of sparking a
  direct military clash with Iran, diplomats said.
      They said the American decision inevitably carries some
  risk of armed confrontation, but Iran -- despite its blunt
  rhetoric -- would want to avoid this as much as Washington.
      ""As Iran knows very well, what America is bringing into the
  Gulf could do serious damage,"" said one western diplomat.
      Diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attacks
  on ""soft targets"" such as merchant shipping not protected by
  American or other western navy vessels patrolling the Gulf.
      The risk of Iranian attack on U.S. Warships or Kuwaiti oil
  tankers carrying the U.S. Flag and under naval escort is rated
  by diplomats as low. However, ""There is the threat that the
  Iranians, seeing these heavily protected U.S.-flag tankers,
  will go for softer targets,"" one diplomat said.
      Tehran Radio quoted Iran's top defence spokesman Ali Akbar
  Hashemi Rafsanjani as saying yesterday that Washington was
  ""moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us.""
      The U.S. is increasing its Gulf fleet from seven to 10
  warships and sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to
  patrol just outside the Strait of Hormuz.
      The build-up ties in with U.S. plans to start escorting
  Kuwaiti oil tankers next month, which have been re-registered
  to fly the American flag to give them naval protection.
      Shipping serving Kuwait has come under repeated attack by
  Iran, angered at the emirate's war backing of Iraq.
      Concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed by
  Chinese-made Silkworm missiles, which the U.S. says Iran is
  preparing to deploy near the Strait of Hormuz.
      The Missouri, with its four-escort flotilla, is likely to
  make Iran think twice about using the missiles, diplomats said.
      A military source in the Gulf has said Iran also set up a
  launching site for the Silkworms on captured Iraqi soil in the
  Faw peninsula, within range of Kuwait.
      ""But anything that went as far as a direct attack on Kuwaiti
  territory would be a very serious escalation"" likely moving
  world opinion against Iran, remarked one.
      Some diplomats believe Iran could also consider carrying
  out reprisals against the United States outside the Gulf.
      Rafsanjani, who is also parliamentary leader, predicted
  last Friday ""a river of blood"" throughout the world in the event
  of any U.S. strike against Iran.
      Western diplomats said Iran, which Washington has accused
  of being behind state-sponsored terrorism, had no demonstrable
  capacity to carry out attacks in the U.S. itself.
      Diplomats saw few potential targets in Lebanon now that
  most Americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked to
  pro-Iranian groups. But Europe and Asia were potential
  trouble-spots, and Kuwait was one of the most obvious targets.
      Any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage or
  other action to make it difficult to blame Iran, they added.

"['carcass', 'hog', 'livestock']","STUDY SAYS PORK LEANER THAN USDA FIGURES SHOW
  An Iowa State University study showed
  pork contains considerably less fat than indicated by
  long-established U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics, the
  National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) said.
      Six of the seven muscle cuts evaluated in the study
  averaged 4.3 pct fat or less, well below American Heart
  Association guidelines for recommended foods. Eighty pct of all
  the raw boneless rib chops evaluated in the study contained
  less than six pct fat, the NPPC said.
      Meanwhile, USDA Handbook 8-10 - long used as the
  established authority on nutrient composition, indicates a fat
  content for center loin pork of 7.3 pct, the NPPC said.
      Robin Kline, a dietitian and Director of Consumer Affairs
  for the NPPC said he was not surprised at the wide discrepancy
  between the study and the USDA handbook.
      ""Handbook 8-10 is based to a certain extent on information
  that has been accumulated over the past 30 years. The
  statistics in it about pork do not reflect the hog of today
  which is about 50 pct leaner than it was 20 or 30 years ago,
  thanks to genetic improvements and better feeding practices,""
  Kline said.
      The study, funded by NPPC with producer checkoff money,
  evaluated pork carcasses from 47 Iowa producers in categories
  from 0.7 to 1.3 inches of backfat. Researchers measured the fat
  content of the seven muscles before cooking, and the fat,
  moisture and tenderness of cooked boneless rib chops.

  The relatively high level of real U.S.
  interest rates suggests that there is scope for further
  declines in money market rates, but the Federal Reserve is
  unlikely to promote such a drop as long as the dollar remains
  volatile, said J.P. Morgan and Co Inc chairman Lewis Preston.
      He said in response to a reporter's question after the
  bank's annual meeting that money market rates could decline
  further but, ""I don't think the Fed is going to encourage that
  as long as the exchange markets are as volatile as they are.""
      On the other hand, he said that, barring a collapse of the
  dollar, he did not see rates going much higher.
      He said that Morgan's recent rise in its prime lending rate
  was ""purely a reflection of an increase in a whole spectrum of
  rates.""
      Preston reiterated earlier company forecasts that the U.S.
  economy should show roughly 2.5 to three pct real growth this
  year.
      He also said that as a consequence of the dollar's decline
  and oil price rises, inflation would rise ""moderately"" to a 3.5

  Hungary has announced sharp price
  increases for a range of food and consumer products as part of
  its efforts to curb a soaring budget deficit.
      The official MTI news agency said the government decided
  consumer price subsidies had to be cut to reduce state
  spending. From today the price of meat will rise by an average
  18 pct and that of beer and spirits by 10 pct, MTI said.
      The measures are also aimed at cooling an overheated
  economy, and could help dampen Hungarians' appetite for
  imported Western goods which consume increasingly expensive
  hard currency, the diplomats said.
      The diplomats also said, however, that they did not expect
  the kind of social unrest that followed sharp price rises in
  other East Bloc states, notably Poland.
      MTI said consumer goods will also become more expensive,

      The office and technical workers last negotiated May 21.
  Production at Trail and Kimberley has been shut down since the

  Fritz Leutwiler, chairman of
  BBC AG Brown Boveri und Cie and a former Swiss National Bank

  achieving a rising rate for the mark against the Swiss franc.
      In a speech to shareholders, Leutwiler said, ""A gradually
  rising rate for the mark in relation to the franc would be
  desirable from the standpoint of industrial exports and with
  regard to sustaining Swiss industry.""
      ""Simply an appropriate declaration of intent by our bank of
  issue (Swiss National Bank) could have a positive effect,"" he
  said.
      Leutwiler, who served 10 years as head of the Swiss central
  bank, said such a step would not contradict the National Bank's
  target of monetary stability.
      ""Bringing the franc close to the mark would, of course, have
  to be done step by step under the watchful eye of monetary
  policy,"" he told shareholders. ""Realistically there is in fact no
  persuasive reason why the German currency is quoted almost 20
  pct lower than the Swiss.""
      A National Bank spokesman said the relation of the mark and
  Swiss franc was an example of stable currency parities over a
  long period of time.
      The spokesman said exchange rates were made by the market,
  not the central bank, and it would be impossible to influence
  individual parities separately.
      Leutwiler said the Swiss National Bank could not support
  the value of the dollar, even in conjunction with other central
  banks, without putting monetary stability in jeopardy.
      ""I would be the last to recommend that. The key to a

"['grain', 'orange', 'sugar']","CHINA PROVINCE BECOMES GRAIN IMPORTER
  The south China province of Guangdong is
  importing millions of tonnes of grain a year from overseas and
  other parts of China because farmers have switched from grain
  to more profitable crops, the Peking Review magazine said.
      The official magazine said the province's grain area fell
  to 4.33 mln hectares in 1985 from 5.7 mln in 1978 out of a
  total farmland area of 7.4 mln hectares.
      Farmers have switched to cash crops such as sugarcane,
  bananas, oranges, papaya and freshwater fish-farming, in part
  to supply major consumer markets in Hong Kong and Macao, the
  magazine said. It gave no 1986 area figures.
      The magazine said China aims to keep 80 pct of national
  farmland under grain, 10 pct under cash crops and 10 pct under
  other crops, although the ratio will vary from place to place.
      It said primitive cultivation methods, labour-intensity and
  low productivity make grain the least profitable farm
  commodity. Farmers in one central region of China can from 0.1
  hectare earn 2,250 yuan a year from vegetables, 375-450 yuan
  from cotton or 225 yuan from grain, it added.
      It said consumer prices for foodgrain can be adjusted only

      The boards of both companies have approved the merger,

      Under the agreement, the Boeing subsidiary, TBC Holdings

['coffee'],"UGANDA PULLS OUT OF COFFEE MARKET - TRADE SOURCES
  Uganda's Coffee Marketing Board (CMB)
  has stopped offering coffee on the international market because
  it is unhappy with current prices, coffee trade sources said.
      The board suspended offerings last week but because of its
  urgent need for cash it was not immediately clear how long it
  could sustain, the sources added.
      Hundreds of Ugandan coffee farmers and processors have been
  waiting several months for payment from the CMB, which has had
  trouble finding enough railway wagons to move the coffee to the
  Kenyan port of Mombasa.
      Foreign banks have contributed to the cash crisis by
  holding up remittance of Uganda's hard currency earnings from
  coffee exports, the government newspaper New Vision said.
      The banks are holding up to seven mln dlrs in coffee money
  and President Yoweri Museveni is thinking of imposing a penalty
  for such delays, it added.
      Banking sources said a third factor in the crisis was that
  commercial banks have lent the board only 77 billion shillings
  -- the equivalent of 55 mln dlrs -- for crop finance in the
  current coffee year, while the government had asked for 100
  billion.
      The CMB has 455,000 60-kg bags of coffee, about 15 pct of
  annual production, stockpiled in Kampala awaiting shipment.
      The crop accounts for over 90 pct of Uganda's export
  earnings and the recent slide in prices to four-year lows is
  likely to more than offset an expected increase in production.
      CMB officials have forecast that because the government has
  restored law and order in important growing areas, Uganda will
  produce over three mln bags of coffee in the year ending
  September 30, about 25 pct more than in 1985/6.

  Venezuela has obtained more than 300 mln

      'We can say that we are achieving the recuperation of
  credit, but that cannot be done overnight,' Azpurua said in a
  television interview.
      He said a credit agreement for 100 mln marks will be signed
  this week with the German state bank Kreditanstalt fur
  Wiederaufbau (KFW), to finance an expansion of the state
  aluminum company Venalum.
      The credit will be divided into two separate agreements,
  one for 85 mln marks with an interest rate of 6.13 pct, and
  another for 15 mln marks, at 6.20 pct.
      Azpurua said financing has also been obtained for expansion
  of Alcasa, another state aluminum company, and for projects in
  the state steel and petrochemical industries.
      Yesterday, he said Venezuela obtained two new credits of
  5.0 mln dlrs each for export financing, one from Credit du Nord
  of France and the other from Britain's Midland Bank.
      The Venezuelan government has been criticised at home for
  failing to obtain new credits, despite its insistence on
  repaying foreign debt according to the terms of a rescheduling
  accord reached last February.
      Azpurua recently visited Tokyo hoping to acquire new

  Merrill Lynch and Co Inc &lt;MER>
  subsidiary seeking to take over of Borg-Warner Corp said it
  could realize a 30 mln dlr fee for its efforts, whether or not
  the deal, which it values at 4.7 billion dlrs, succeeds.
      In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
  Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc said it would receive a 30
  mln dlr fee from the surviving company for acting as dealer
  manager of the merger after the Borg-Warner deal is completed.
      But it said it could also receive a break-up fee of 30 mln
  dlrs if the deal fails for reasons, which include another party
  holding more than 40 pct of its stock or tendering for 50 pct.
      The 30 mln dlr fee is among the highest set down in any
  tender offer agreement, either in compensation for dealer
  manager services or for break-up of the deal.
      Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, backed by a group of
  investors it organized, has launched a 48.50 dlr a share tender
  offer for Borg-Warner for 90 pct of its stock.
      The company's board has approved the plan, which was
  intended to thwart an unsolicited offer from GAF Corp.
      Borg-Warner also agreed to redeem all outstanding Series A
  preferred shares and to pay off on all options at a 48.50 dlr a
  share exercise price before the merger is effective, it said.
      Merrill Lynch said its representatives discussed a possible
  leveraged buyout with Borg-Warner as early as last December.
      At that time, Merrill Lynch told the company it would
  consider a 43 dlr a share tender offer in cash and securities,
  if the Borg-Warner board approved, it said. On Feb 24, it said
  it was told the company had decided against a buyout.
      But talks were revived after GAF launched its 46 dlr a
  share proposal on March 31, Merrill Lynch said.
      Unlike its earlier proposal, Merrill Lynch said Borg-Warner
  management was asked not to take part in the new deal and it
  was conditioned upon payment of the fees.
      In addition to its fees, Merrill Lynch said it will also
  get up to 17 mln dlrs from Borg-Warner to cover its expenses in
  the tender offer.
      Merrill Lynch said it would continue operating Borg-Warner
  as a subsidiary with its current officers keeping their
  positions.
      But for flexibility purposes, Merrill Lynch said it is
  considering redistributing Borg-Warner's assets to a number of
  subsdiaries of an entity it created to carry out the merger.
      All in all Merrill Lynch estimated that there would be 130
  mln dlrs in fees and expenses connected with the deal.
      Another 250 mln dlrs will be needed to repay certain debt
  of Borg-Warner, Merrill Lynch said.
      To finance the deal, Merrill Lynch said it expects to
  borrow 3.5 billion dlrs from a group of banks and sell 100 mln
  dlrs of common stock of the new company, sell 100 mln dlrs of
  non-voting preferred stock of the new company to Merrill Lynch
  and Co, sell up to 650 mln dlrs of subordinated notes to
  Merrill Lynch and Co and sell to the public 204 mln dlrs of
  subordinated discount debentures.

['money-fx'],"LAWSON CALLS INTERVENTION PROOF OF STABILITY GOAL
  The scale of foreign exchange intervention
  the Bank of England has carried out recently is clear proof of
  Britain's determination to stabilise exchange rates as agreed
  between the Group of Seven industrialised countries in Paris in
  February, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.
      Saying he was ""content"" with sterling's current value, Lawson
  told reporters he wanted ""to maintain the exchange rate
  stability we have all signed up for."" He declined to say if he
  favoured a rise or a fall from present sterling levels.
   May currency reserves, out today, showed a record 4.8 billion
  stg rise, pointing to massive currency intervention.
      In April, reserves rose a hefty 2.9 billion stg.
      Pointing to the reserves data, Lawson said, ""We have been
  playing a very full part ourselves"" in meeting our commitments
  toward exchange rate stability as agreed in Paris.
      ""We wish to see it (stability) continuing,"" he added.
      Asked which techniques were available to preserve
  stability, Lawson said both central bank intervention and
  interest rate changes could be used to tackle ""the market
  pressures there are from time to time.""
      ""Interest rate stability is not an objective in that
  sense...Rates have to be moved up and down at times,"" he added.
      Lawson said he expected intervention to be ""sterilised"" by
  draining excess sterling liquidity from the market through new
  issues of government securities and foreign currency sales,
  when the market allowed.
      This would limit the inflationary impact of intervention,
  he said.
      ""Sterilisation will be dictated by market tactics...Not
  necessarily in the month in which intervention occurs,"" Lawson
  said. ""I am confident that we can sterilise on this scale.""

  Finland's national oil company Neste Oy
  &lt;NEOY.HE> said in a statement it had agreed with Canadian firms
  to study the feasibility of building a plant in Edmonton,
  Canada, to produce a replacement for lead in petrol.
      The prospective plant would cost an estimated 270 mln
  Canadian dlrs and would produce methyl tertiary butyl ether
  (MTBE) from raw materials available locally, it said.
      The partners in the study are Neste Oy, Celanese Canada
  Inc, Hoechst Celanese Corporation and Trade Mountain Pipe Line
  Company Ltd, of Vancouver, B.C.
      The Edmonton site was suitable because of the raw materials
  availability, the proximity to pipeline transportation and the
  important capital and operating advantages gained by locating
  on an existing Celanese Canada site, the statement said.
      The partners would look into the feasibility of a plant
  producing 500,000 tonnes per annum of MTBE, an octane enhancer
  that can replace tetra ethyl lead.
      Most of the MTBE would be targeted for the United States
  where lead levels in gasoline are being lowered because of
  health concerns, the statement added.
      Canadian lead limits are currently 11 times as high as the
  U.S. Limit but lead is scheduled for virtual elimination in
  Canada by 1993, which should create a Canadian demand for MTBE,
  it said.
      Finland's Neste Oy, whose turnover last year was over five
  billion dlrs, has extensive experience with MTBE. It has a
  major investment in an MTBE plant in Saudi Arabia.

  Norway's state oil company
  Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) &lt;STAT.OL>, has told
  Thai authorities it is interested in taking a 30 pct share in a
  big offshore Thailand gas field, Statoil said.
      The field, in the southern sector of the Gulf of Thailand,
  is currently operated by U.S. Oil company Texas Pacific Oil Co
  Inc, a unit of Canada's Seagram Co Ltd &lt;VO.N>. Thailand's state
  oil company &lt;Petroleum Authority Thailand> (PTT) also holds a
  major stake in the field.
      PTT wants to develop the field and has asked Statoil to
  consider co-development if the field's licence is renewed.
      PTT, according to Statoil, is currently negotiating with
  Texas Pacific to buy back the Dallas-based oil company's
  holdings in the field.
      ""PTT must first sort out its problems with Texas Pacific.
  When this is done, we have said we are interested in taking
  over a 30 pct share in the field,"" Statoil spokesman Willy Olsen
  told Reuters.
      Statoil, hired by PTT to carry out an independent appraisal
  of the field's reserves and propose a development plan, has
  estimated the field could be commercially developed at a cost
  of some 700 mln crowns.
      Industry sources said Texas Pacific has submitted lower
  reserve estimates for the field than Statoil and shown little
  interest in its development. Statoil refused to disclose its
  upgraded reserve estimate for the field.
      The field's reserves could be sold domestically through
  Thailand's gas distribution network or by converting the gas to
  electricity, the sources said.
      Sources would not say which field Statoil is considering.

  Ecuador is due to resume limited crude oil

      Oil output was halted on March 5 by an earthquake which
  damaged 50 km of the main pipeline linking jungle oilfields at

  Bank of Japan sources said the bank
  has no plans to cut its discount rate.
      They told reporters that there was no pressure on Japan
  during the Group of Seven (G-7) meeting here yesterday to lower
  its discount rate. They added that they themselves do not feel
  any need for a cut at all.
      Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reporters
  earlier today that some countries - those with strong
  currencies - might have to cut interest rates.
      The Bank of Japan sources also said that it was too soon to
  call the G-7 pact a failure.
      The central bank sources were commenting on the dollar's
  renewed tumble in New York and Tokyo, which was sparked by
  remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the
  dollar's fall had been orderly.
      They said the market must have misinterpreted Baker's
  comments because he was referring to the dollar's fall since
  the Plaza agreement in September 1985, over a long-time span,
  not the currency's recent movements.
      They added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seize
  on anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way or
  the other.
      The Bank of Japan sources said the U.S. Is putting more
  weight on the dollar/yen rate in terms of judging market
  stability than on other currencies.
      Throughout the G-7 meeting, Japan pointed to the dangers
  that would arise from a further dollar fall because it would
  reduce the flow of Japanese capital to the U.S., Hurting the
  U.S. And world economies, they said.
      In February and in March of this year, Japanese investors
  reduced their purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, the sources
  said.
      Each country in the G-7 - Britain, Canada, France, Italy,
  Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - has a different view about
  currency stability, the Bank of Japan sources said.
      This is because the overall foreign exchange market is a
  triangle of dollar/yen, European currencies/yen and
  dollar/European currencies.
      At the time of the Louvre agreement, European countries did
  not want the yen to weaken against their currencies so they did
  not object to the yen strengthening, they said.

  The Louvre accord on currency stability,
  which has maintained an uneasy calm in currency markets since
  last February, appeared in serious danger today as a
  transatlantic dispute over West German interest rates came to
  the boil, foreign exchange dealers said.
      But as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock and
  bond markets plunged, officials in the major industrial
  countries played down the dispute as a bilateral problem
  between the United States and West Germany and insisted that
  the currency pact was still alive.
      U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the market
  fears when he attacked the rise in West German short-term
  interest rates. ""That's not in keeping with the spirit of what
  we agreed to as recently as earlier this month in Washington,""
  Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday. He was
  referring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Group
  of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed the
  pact.
      Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan, who both
  have large trade surpluses, pledged to boost their economic
  growth to take in more exports from the U.S., While the U.S.
  Agreed to stop talking the dollar down.
      However, Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvre
  agreement was still operative, the West German interest rate
  move would force the U.S. To re-examine the accord.
      ""The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker that
  he's going to hammer Germany ... He has just declared all bets
  are off in terms of currency cooperation,"" Chris Johns, currency
  analyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said.
      But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguine
  view, telling Reuters that ""the exchange market is apparently
  reacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker
  comment will regret it later on.""
      French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, who hosted the
  Louvre meeting, was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers to
  respond directly to Baker's remarks. He called for ""a faithful
  and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the
  Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit.""
      Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the British
  Treasury commented on the row.
      But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despite
  U.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, ""this does
  not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the
  Louvre Accord.""
      In Frankfurt F. Wilhelm Christians, joint chief executive
  of West Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, said that
  following recent meetings with Baker, he believed that the U.S.
  Was still committed to the accord.
      In a move which the market interpreted as a possible
  gesture of reconciliation, the Bundesbank added short-term
  liquidity to the West German money market at 3.80 pct on
  Monday, down from the 3.85 pct level at which it injected
  medium-term liquidity last week. The Bank of France also
  stepped into the French money market to hold down rates,
  injecting short-term liquidity at 7-3/4 pct after rates rose
  close to eight pct.

      Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs

"['acq', 'crude']","JAPAN OIL INDUSTRY DECONTROL MAY LEAD TO MERGERS
  Deregulation of Japan's oil industry could
  mean hardship for smaller firms and lead to their merging into
  bigger refining and marketing groups, industry sources said.
      They said the relaxation of controls was now under review
  by the Petroleum Council, an advisory panel to the Ministry of
  International Trade and Industry (MITI).
      A spokesman for a major firm said, ""Deregulation would bring
  about a reorganization. If it's a by-product of freer
  competition, we have no choice but to accept it.""
      The Council is due to close its discussions on June 12.
      The sources said the Council was likely to tell MITI it
  should end its 50 year-old protection of the industry. It
  should cut capacity to 3.8 mln barrels per day, about 75 pct of
  current capacity. Quotas should end for crude throughput and
  gasoline output, and oil tariffs should be abolished.
      They said deregulation was vital to promote more
  competition and efficiency, and most saw it as inevitable.
      ""Deregulation is taking place everywhere. Now it's our turn
  to see if we can survive cut-throat competition,"" said a source
  at one major Japanese oil company.
      A spokesman for a smaller refiner said, ""We'll have a hard
  time surviving, but that's something we must go through.""
      ""In addition to our streamlining and efficiency programs for
  the oil division, we will exert efforts towards branching out
  further into other lines such as real estate and travel
  agencies,"" he said.
      Larger companies are also streamlining. Nippon Oil Co Ltd
  which had the largest share of refined products sales in the
  Japanese market in fiscal 1985, cut nine pct of its refining
  capacity in fiscal 1986.
      Cosmo Oil Co Ltd, the third largest seller of oil products
  in 1985, cut its workforce by some 20 pct last year, a
  spokesman for the company said.
      Between 1984 and 1986, on the recommendation of the
  Council, 13 oil companies were integrated into 11 companies
  within seven refining and marketing groups to improve the
  efficiency of the industry.
      Oil industry sources said this structure was now likely to
  be streamlined further into five refining groups.
      ""MITI means business. It will urge the major seven groups to
  merge into five to build up their muscles,"" a source said.
      A MITI official told Reuters he did not rule out the
  possibility of further mergers within the Japanese oil industry
  in the event of the relaxation of oil controls.
      He declined to officially confirm or deny that the
  Petroleum Council had recommended deregulatory measures but
  said that in principal MITI would encourage a move towards
  deregulation.

['money-fx'],"LAWSON SAYS LOUVRE CURRENCY ACCORD SATISFACTORY
  The Louvre agreement by the Group of Seven
  finance ministers and central bankers to stabilise currencies
  has worked well and needs no fundamental strengthening at the
  economic summit in Venice on June 8-10, U.K. Chancellor of the
  Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.
      Previewing the summit, which he expected would not produce
  any major new economic initiatives, Lawson told reporters work
  remained to be done on improving the conditions for lasting
  world economic growth.üside measures to boost growth, he said.
  
      ""I think it is possible that there may be scope for a
  further reduction in interest rates in Germany,"" he added, but
  stressed that he had had no indication that such a move was
  likely. He made no mention of Japanese interest rates.
      Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on ""a gradual reduction
  of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years.""
      He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced
  ""satisfactory exchange rate stability,"" in part thanks to heavy
  coordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, and
  he was ""content"" with sterling's exchange rate.
      Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. May
  currency reserves announced today he said, ""we have been playing
  a very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to a
  very much greater extent than we had done hitherto.""
      Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement may
  falter if member states did not implement the macro-economic
  commitments underlying the accord.
      ""Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange
  rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their
  commitments in Paris ... In this respect."" He said the U.S.
  Budget deficit was ""very important.""
      Noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by
  Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawson
  said, ""what is really needed in Japan is an increase in
  merchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical.""
      ""There is a specific range of consumer and agricultural
  goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is
  wholly unjustified,"" he said.
      Lawson doubted that Tokyo's partners would indulge in ""Japan
  bashing"" at the summit especially after the economic stimulation
  package and the announcement of Nakasone's plans to increase
  Japanese development aid over the next three years.
      Japan's more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchange
  membership would also help deflect criticism, he said.
      He said he thought West Germany would instead come under
  pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to
  jack up faltering economic growth.
      In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bring
  forward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts
  scheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn to push ahead with
  the privatisation of German national industries.
      On debt, Lawson said he expected a three point British plan
  to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries to
  make progress in Venice.
      The plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign
  debt in the Paris Club, was first proposed at the IMF and World
  Bank meetings in Washington earlier this year.
      Lawson said he would seek ""to consolidate political backing
  for the plan at the Venice summit"" and hoped the programme would
  be finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank.
      He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and Chase
  Manhattan to increase sharply their Third World debt
  provisions.
      ""First, it is a blow for realism. Second, because the market
  response has shown that banks have much less to fear from this
  sort of move than they felt before Citicorp,"" he said.
      U.K. Banks should follow Bank of England recommendations,
  strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions.
  ""They have done it to some extent, they need to do it more,""
  Lawson said, adding it was up to the banks themselves to
  determine the appropriate size of provisions.
      He also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be
  discussed at the summit. ""There is a consensus, which we have to
  push further.""

  Malaysia is unlikely to meet its
  targeted output of five mln tonnes of oil palm in calendar
  1987, oil palm growers told Reuters.
      Output in 1987 is expected to reach around 4.5 mln tonnes,
  unchanged from 1986, because of drought, low use of fertiliser
  and overstressed palms, they said.
      The growers were asked for their reaction to an Oil World
  newsletter report that Malaysia's oil palm output is likely to
  drop sharply this year.
      Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne, or about
  115 ringgit less than soybean oil, but Malaysia must sell more
  palm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage the
  industry, a leading grower told Reuters.
      The country's palm oil stocks now total some 500,000 tonnes
  against about 800,000 last March, the growers said.
      The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this year
  due to pressure from South American and U.S. Soybean output.
      The current South American oilseed harvest, mainly soybean,
  is likely to be around 25.7 mln tonnes against the previous
  21.7 mln tonne crop, they said.
      In addition, new U.S. Soybean plantings are also expected
  to enter the market around November when Malaysian palm oil
  output peaks.
      They said new planting of palms is also likely to slow,
  with some 50,000 hectares expected to be planted with new trees
  against 100,000 in 1986, although the effects of this reduction
  will not be felt for about another three years.

  The Bank of France said in its latest
  monthly report on the French economy it expected a pickup in
  industrial production registered in March to gather steam over
  the next few months.
      Without giving figures, the report said last month's rise,
  partly linked to efforts to catch up with production lost
  earlier this year through industrial action, was due mainly to
  a firming of domestic demand.
      ""New progress is expected in all main sectors except capital
  goods where production will remain at its present level,"" the

      The upbeat report comes in the wake of grim March trade

      While the automobile industry remained unchanged from
  previously boosted levels, consumer goods production grew and
  was expected to accelerate except in the area of domestic

"['bop', 'gnp', 'jobs']","OECD URGES ACTION TO CUT U.S. BUDGET DEFICIT
  The United States should take urgent
  action to cut its crippling budget deficit, including possible
  reductions in non-defense spending, higher taxes and curbs on
  growth of the defense budget, the Organization for Economic
  Cooperation and Development said.
      The OECD, in its semi-annual review of the world economy,
  said a failure of the Reagan Administration and Congress
  quickly to agree on measures to cut the deficit ""could seriously
  affect confidence, both in the United States and elsewhere.""
      It predicted that the federal deficit in fiscal 1987,
  running until September 30 this year, would substantially
  overshoot both the Balanced Budget Act's target of 144 billion
  dlrs and official U.S. Estimates in February of 175 billion.
      ""The OECD projection, which is based on assumptions of
  slower growth, higher interest rates and actual data for the
  first half of the financial year, is for a deficit of about 190
  billion dollars,"" it said.
      While this would be 30 billion lower than last year's
  deficit, much of the improvement would be due to corporate tax
  increases being introduced before income tax cuts take effect.
      The U.S. Economic growth rate is expected to edge up to
  2.75 pct next year from 2.5 pct this year and last.
      In contrast to the last two years, more competitive exports
  boosted by the fall in the dollar should help GNP growth.
      Unemployment should continue to fall slowly as the service
  sector continues to create jobs. But inflation appears to be
  heading higher, partly due to the lower dollar, with consumer
  prices forecast to rise four pct this year and 4.5 pct next
  year after just 2.1 pct in 1986.
      ""Monetary and fiscal policy appear to be the key factors
  behind the avoidance of recession,"" the report said.
      The current account balance of payments deficit is expected
  to be still around a high 125 billion dlrs next year, after
  hitting a projected record 147.25 billion this year, it said.
      In Canada economic growth is expected to pick up slightly
  to around 2.75 pct in 1988 from 2.5 pct this year, but will
  still be below levels seen in recent years. Inflation is
  expected to slow to 3.5 pct next year from 3.75 pct this year,
  unemployment should edge down to nine pct in 1988 from 9.25 pct
  this year.
      Canada's current account deficit is projected to shrink to
  around four billion U.S. Dlrs this year and to remain at about
  that level in 1988.

      At an analysts meeting here the company said that for the
  year ending April 30, 1987 it will earn about 73 mln dlrs, or
  about 5.15-5.35 dlrs a share on sales of about 500 mln dlrs.
      In the year ago period, the company earned 53.4 mln dlrs,
  or 3.65 dlrs a share, on sales of 402.8 mln dlrs.
      Winston Wallin, Medtronic chairman, said the company will
  improve market share in fiscal 1988 in cardiac pacemakers and
  expand its cardiovascular therapeutic product line.
      Wallin cautioned analysts not to quickly change their per
  share estimates for the company as he said Medtronic will have
  heavy sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 1988.
      He said the company intends to reinvest its earnings in its
  businesses and not in its dividends. ""Shareholders are better
  off if we grow the business rather than reinvest in dividends
  or share repurchases,"" he said.
      Wallin said he sees Medtronic's share of the total
  worldwide pacemaker market increasing to 42 pct in fiscal 1988,
  from 40 pct in fiscal 1987.
      He said the worldwide market for cardiovascualr therapeutic
  products, which includes pacemakers, valves, catheters and
  lasers, will be valued at about 2.5 billion dlrs 1990 and will
  double that by 1995.
      Wallin said, ""Our objective is to get a hold of new
  products and start building market share if we have to beg,
  borrow or steal to get into new markets.""
      In the past, Medtronic's pacemakers have been plagued with
  a number of problems leading to product recalls. Regulators
  also have criticized the industry, citing quality problems and
  a needless overprescription of pacemakers.
      ""We have no knowledge of any major problems in our
  pacemakers or leads,"" Wallin said. ""We intend to re-establish
  our company as the quality leader in the industry.""
      Glen Nelson, executive vice president for Medtronics, said
  the company intends to diversify internally and through
  acquisitions of companies in areas of Medtronic's expertise,
  such as drug delivery systems.
      Wallin said the 15 pct earnings growth for fiscal 1988 does
  not include dilutions from acquisitions. ""We hope to have some
  safety provisions so that we won't have any major dilutions
  from an acquisition.""
      Wallin also said the company will have virtual exclusivity
  in rate responsive pacemakers for all of fiscal 1988.
      The company markets Activitrax, the first single chamber

  The Soviet Union outlined its economic
  targets for 1988 on Monday, stressing the need to improve
  standards in the country's sluggish engineering industry.
      Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told the Supreme Soviet
  industrial output should rise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from a
  planned 4.4 pct in 1987. It rose 3.6 pct in Jan-Sept 1987.
      Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalent
  to gross national product, should rise by 4.3 pct against a
  planned 4.1 pct this year. Gross national product measures the
  output of a country's goods and services.
      He said the Kremlin planned to produce 235 mln tonnes of
  grain in 1988 versus a planned 232 mln this year. Moscow
  produced 210 mln tonnes in 1986.
      Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described
  machine-builing as a sector whose rapid modernization is
  essential if the Soviet Union is to compete effectively on
  world markets.
      ""Certain difficulties have arisen this year in the
  machine-building industry. The economy is not receiving a
  considerable amount of the equipment that it requires,"" said
  Talyzin, who heads the state planning committee GOSPLAN.
      Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makes
  machine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,
  increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of 1987
  compared with the same period last year.
      However, this was far below the 7.3 pct increase planned
  for the industry for the whole of 1988.
      Talyzin said the ruling Politburo had concluded at a recent
  meeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to
  a large extent on conserving resources better. ""Large-scale
  measures are planned to save resources,"" he said.
      Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet that
  defense spending in 1988 would total 32 billion dlrs, the same
  figure as was announced last year.
      Western governments view official Soviet estimates for
  defense spending as highly understated, but say the real figure
  is hard to calculate because Soviet military industries are
  intertwined with the civilian economy.
      Talyzin said the Kremlin also decided to increase spending
  next year on medical services, education, pensions and social
  insurance schemes.

  A major animal feed producer, Cehave

  application of the European Community grain co-responsibility
  levy, with the full backing of the Dutch animal grain and feed
  trade association, Het Comite, association chief executive
  Peter Pex told Reuters.
      Oral proceedings were held in the Hague on Friday and the
  court said it would give its verdict within six weeks. ""However,
  that is the normal wording and we expect the Hague court to
  refer questions on the interpretation and application of the
  levy to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg,"" Pex added.
      Het Comite claims the way the levy is applied does not take
  account of currency cross-rates of exchange and can mean a
  compounder in one country being asked to pay a higher levy in
  its own national currency than it received down the chain from
  the original producer of the grain.
      ""We would like the Business Administration Court in the
  Hague to ask the Luxembourg Court of Justice not only whether
  the Dutch Grain Commodity Board, the levy collection agency,
  has interpreted the levy regulations correctly, but also
  whether the regulations themselves may contravene European law,""
  Pex said.
      ""It is only with great regret that we have taken this route,
  but we have had no political help, and therefore have no option
  even though it could take years,"" Pex added.
      Het Comite asked CHV to act as a test case against the
  grain levy because the bill the company received from the
  commodity board included grain from a wide variety of origins
  and was therefore considered to be the best general basis for a
  legal challenge to the levy, Pex noted.
      Het Comite's actions will run in tandem with questions on
  the levy already posed to the Luxembourg Court in a case
  brought by the Association of European Animal Feed

"['crude', 'gas']","SMALL RISE SEEN IN U.S. GASOLINE INVENTORIES
  U.S. analysts expect the American
  Petroleum Institute's weekly report on oil inventories to show
  a slight build in U.S. stocks of gasoline for the week ended
  May 29, oil traders and analysts said.
      While the consensus is for an increase, a few would not
  rule out the possibility of an decline. Traders said that
  barring any surprises in tonight's report, they expect the
  report to be neutral to bearish for oil prices.
      Heating oil stocks are also likely to build and runs to be
  steady to slightly higher, which could add pressure on oil
  prices, the analysts said.
      Crude oil was seen likely to build assuming imports
  continue at relatively high levels.
      Analysts expect gasoline stocks to rise 500,000 to two mln
  barrels above the 234 mln reported for May 22.
      Peter Beutel, oil analyst with Elders Futures inc, who
  looks for a build said, ""We have had five weeks of gasoline
  demand at 7.3 mln bpd or more and it is likely to taper off to
  between 6.7-7.0 mln bpd, which should make stocks build. Demand
  would have to stay above 7.0 mln bpd to have a draw,"" he added.
      Rising demand is why oil traders and analysts expect a draw
  in stocks of about of about one mln barrels.
     
      The U.S. Energy Information Administration in its latest
  report for the four weeks ending may 22 said that gasoline
  demand was up 4.4 pct to 7.3 mln bpd from the previous year.
      But analysts said hopes of reduced stocks is likely to
  founder on increased runs in refineries, which could be up 0.3
  pct above May 22's 81.2 pct capacity operated.
      Such an increase would raise runs about 100,000 bpd and add
  to U.S. stocks.
      But some analysts said that refiners may have held refinery
  runs.
      Heating oil stocks were also expected to build between
  700,000 barrels and one mln from the 96 mln barrel level
  reported last week, but a rise in distillate stocks was
  discounted as having a market impact at this time.
      ""A build is seasonal now and not out of line with last year,""
  one futures analyst said.
      Analysts said they also expect crude oil stocks to build
  between 1.5 mln barrels and three mln from the 325 mln barrels

      The consensus appears for about two mln barrels to be added

"['carcass', 'orange', 'rice', 'trade']","LYNG OPENS JAPAN TALKS ON FARM TRADE BARRIERS
  U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
  opens talks with Japanese government officials today well aware
  his demand for the opening of Japanese rice, beef and citrus
  markets is likely to be rejected.
       But in an interview with Reuters during the flight to
  Tokyo yesterday, Lyng said the goal of his trip was to throw an
  international spotlight on Japan's agricultural import
  protection in the hope pressure would build on Tokyo to open
  its markets.
      ""(The Japanese) have said they are happy we are coming, but
  they are not going to give us anything,"" Lyng said.
      U.S. Officials do not expect any Japanese concessions
  during Lyng's two-week visit here. Any farm trade concessions
  would be unveiled later this month, they said.
      ""If there is anything of consequence to offer (Prime
  Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone would take it with him,"" when he
  visits Washington later in the month, one U.S. Official said.
      Lyng plans to ask Japan to open the door to rice imports by
  partially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases.
      A private U.S. Rice trader visited Tokyo last week
  requesting Japan buy 200,000 tonnes of rice for industrial uses
  such as making sake. Japan has rejected the overture, saying
  Tokyo maintains a policy of self-sufficiency in rice.
      Lyng will also press Japan to eliminate an import quota for
  beef by April 1988 because he believes Japanese consumers would
  like to buy much more beef than currently allowed.
      He cited the example of a California company which
  transports live U.S. Cattle to Japan by air for slaughter to
  circumvent the beef quota. The cost of transport is higher than
  the value of the animal, he said.
      U.S. Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry Promotion
  Corporation which regulates beef imports, was forced to borrow
  from the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986
  quota was exhausted and Japanese beef prices were rising. Japan
  has said it cannot open its markets to beef imports.
      Along with beef, the U.S. Will also press Japan to
  eliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice by
  April, 1988. Some U.S. Officials believe Japan may eventually
  be willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges because
  liberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanese
  mandarin orange industry.
      The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate because
  imports might replace domestic produced juice, U.S. And
  Japanese officials have said.
     Lyng has resurrected a past U.S. Proposal that Japan buy
  surplus U.S. Foodgrains for donation to developing countries,
  but some U.S. Officials are skeptical action will be taken.
     Lyng will also urge Japan to put its domestic farm policies,
  including rice, on the negotiating table during GATT talks in
  Geneva. He said Japan must eliminate import quotas on certain
  minor food products or face possible U.S. Reprisals.

"['corn', 'grain', 'wheat']","FRENCH SAY WHEAT STOCKS FORECAST NO SURPRISE
  The U.S. Department of Agriculture's
  forecast that French end-of-season soft wheat stocks will
  almost double in 1987/88 is premature but would not be
  surprising, according to French cereal organisation officials.
      The Cereals Intervention Board, ONIC, Wheat Producers'
  Association and the National Union of Agricultural and Cereal
  Cooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports or
  end-of-season stocks.
      However, the officials said the USDA's figure of end
  1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87's 2.87 mln
  was not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April.
      The French Feed Cereals Research Institute, ITCF, forecast
  in mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare for
  soft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 and
  the record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984.
      This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around
  31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry of
  Agriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectares
  against 4.61 mln in 1986/87.
      ONIC's first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaign
  will be released at the beginning of September, an ONIC
  official said.
      Soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult to
  estimate at this stage, both within the European Community and
  to non-EC countries, an ONIC official said.
      He said, however, that among countries to which France
  could increase its wheat exports were Egypt and the Maghreb
  countries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), he said.
      The USDA's forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in
  1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87, while again premature,
  was not out of line with estimates of the French Maize
  Producers Association, AGPM, an AGPM official said.
      Maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields were
  expected to be higher, the AGPM official said.
      It estimated 1987/88 maize plantings of 1.73 mln hectares,
  down seven pct from the 1.87 mln hectares planted in 1986/87.

  proposed 1.5 billion dlr takeover of American Motors Corp.
      The letter of intent signed by Chrysler and Renault on
  March nine set April nine as the target date for completing
  negotiations.
      However, the letter also allowed room for an extension of
  that date to April 23 if an agreement could not be reached.
      The two companies said they ""now plan to complete work by
  April 23.""
      Chrysler and Renault said, ""Given the complex nature of the
  deal, the need for additional time was to be expected.""
      The March letter of intent between the two companies says
  that Chrysler could ask Renault to extend the agreement date
  ""in the event that prior to April 9, 1987, Chrysler discovers
  an unforeseen problem in the course of its 'due diligence'
  investigation of the company,"" referring to American Motors.
      A Chrysler spokeswoman would not say whether some problem
  had cropped up in the talks. She stuck by the company's
  statement that more time was needed because the talks are
  complex. ""That is our definition of the delay,"" she said.
      Under the previous agreement between Chrysler and Renault,
  their letter of intent would be terminated on April nine or
  when an agreement was reached. But the letter could be amendend
  by a written agreement by both companies.
      The Chrysler spokeswoman said, ""We are still working toward
  a definitive agreement."" Said another Chrysler official who is
  not part of the talks but who would be told if the deal were in

  The West German government's independent
  council of economic experts believes a further stimulation of
  the economy is inappropriate, government spokesman Friedhelm
  Ost said.
      A statement released by Ost after a meeting of Chancellor
  Helmut Kohl and senior government officials with the council
  said the experts believed 1987 ecomomic growth of 1-1/2 to two
  pct was achievable.
      It added the council believed ""an intensification of the
  already expansionary stimulation of monetary and financial
  policy is not called for.""
      Ost's statement said experts believed further pressure on
  West Germany to adapt to external economic factors would not
  increase.
      The government regularly uses the term ""changed external
  economic factors"" when referring to the fall of the dollar,
  which has severely damaged West German exports. Bonn officials
  have said they expect exports to pick up during the year, but
  could still fall below the 1986 level.
      Along with other leading industrial countries, West Germany
  agreed to a package of measures at a meeting in Paris in
  February aimed at stemming the fall of the dollar.
      The stance taken by the experts backs up the official
  position of the West German government ahead of next week's
  seven nation summit in Venice, where Bonn is expected to be
  pressed by the U.S. And other partners to boost its economy.
      West German government officials have stressed Bonn is not
  in a position to stimulate growth further since tax cuts due
  next year and 1990 are already stretching the budget.
      The Bundesbank has also ruled out a quick cut in official
  interest rates although it sees market rates continuing low.
      The experts' prediction for economic growth this year of
  between 1-1/2 and two pct is a slight downward revision from a
  forecast made last November when two pct growth was forecast.
      Many independent forecasters have revised down 1987
  predictions in light of the downturn in exports. The government
  itself has said it expects growth of just under two pct,
  compared with a 2.4 pct expansion in 1986.

"['grain', 'rice', 'sugar']","INDONESIA REJECTS WORLD BANK FARM REFORM PROPOSALS
  Indonesia rejected World Bank
  recommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, as
  the country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5
  billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.
      Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarks
  distributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations met
  at The Hague, said, ""The general argument presented by the Bank
  for this free trade, open economy view is weak.""
      The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages the
  largest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agricultural
  growth was stagnating under subsisides for rice farming.
      The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peaked
  and the subsidies are a waste of money.
      Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides
  an income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies were
  needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,
  exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as
  assisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.
      Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers
  should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the
  government would continue to maintain production targets for
  ""strategic commodities"" such as rice and sugar.
      The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia's
  drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double
  the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country
  would save money by importing the commodity.
      However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need
  to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar
  industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.
      He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the
  agricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry
  develop and because of ""over-production and price intervention
  in the developed nations.""

['sugar'],"CHINA SEEN UNLIKELY TO RAISE SUGAR IMPORTS
  China will not increase sugar imports
  substantially this year because of foreign exchange constraints
  and large stocks, despite falling production and rising
  domestic demand, traders and the official press said.
      ""Despite rapid increases in domestic production over the
  last 30 years, imbalances between supply and demand continue to
  be extremely serious,"" the Farmers Daily said. It said 1986
  plantings fell due to removal of crop incentives, because
  farmers could earn more from other crops and because technical
  and seed improvements had not been widely disseminated.
      The official press had estimated the 1986/87 sugar crop
  (November/March) at 4.82 mln tonnes, down from 5.2 mln a year
  earlier, and domestic consumption at six mln tonnes a year.
      The Yunnan 1986/87 sugar harvest was a record 521,500
  tonnes, the provincial daily said. It gave no year-earlier
  figure. Output in Guangxi was 1.04 mln tonnes, the New China
  News Agency said without giving a year-earlier figure.
      The Nanfang Daily said production in Guangdong province
  fell to estimated 1.92 mln tonnes from 1.96 mln and that the
  area under sugar was dropping.
      ""Supply of cane (in Guangdong) is inadequate,"" the newspaper
  said. Processing costs are rising and the economic situation of
  nearly all the mills is not good. To guarantee supply of cane
  is a major problem.""
      A Western diplomat said sugar output also fell n Fujian,
  south China's fourth major producer, where there was a drop in
  area planted.
      He said the rural sectors in Guangdong and Fujian were wel
  developed, enabling farmers to choose crops according to the
  maximum return, meaning that many had avoided sugar.
      The Farmers Daily said a peasant in the ortheast province
  of Heilongjiang could gross 108 yuan from one mu (0.0667
  hectares) of soybeans and 112 yuan from one mu of corn but only
  70 from one mu of sugarbeet.
      The paper said the profit margin of mills in China fell to
  4.7 pct last year from 11.87 pct in 1980.
      Mills lacked the capital to modernise and they competed
  with each other for raw materialsX, it added. This resulted in
  falling utilisation rates at big, mode{nised mills.
      The price of sugar had not changed in 20 years, the
  official press has said.
      Customs figures showed China imported 1.18 mln tonnes of
  sugar in calendar 1986, down from 1.9 mln in 1985.
      The diplomat said stocks at end-August 1986 were 2.37 mln
  tonnes, up from 1.92 a year earlier.
      A foreign trader here said China accumulated large stocks
  in 1982-85 when provincial authorities were allowed to import
  sugar on their own authority. This practice was stopped in 1986
  when the central government resumed control of imports.
      ""As China lacked storage, much of these imports was stored
  in Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and other inland areas,"" the diplomat
  said.
      The trader said transporting stocks from these areas to
  consumers in east and south China was a problem, particularly
  as coal had priority. ""How quickly they can move the sugar is
  one factor determining import levels,"" he said.
      Another factor was the quality of the harvest in Cuba,
  China's major supplier through barter trade, he said.
      ""China bought two distress cargoes last week, for about
  152/153 dlrs a tonne,"" he added. ""China is not a desperate buyer
  now. But if the Cuban harvest is bad, it will have to go into
  the open market.""
      A Japanese trader said Peking's major concern regarding
  imports was price.
      ""While the foreign trade situation has improved this year,
  foreign exchange restraints persist,"" he said.
      The diplomat said domestic demand was rising by about five
  pct a year but ""a communist government is in a much better
  position to regulate demand than a capitalist one, if the
  foreign exchange situation demands it.""

  The White House has completed a new

  April should be lifted, U.S. officials said.
      They said the president's Economic Policy Council looked at
  Japan's adherence to the 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact
  yesterday and that an announcement may be made shortly.
      But there was no hint what the announcement might be.
      Officials have said the 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs of
  Japanese exports could be modified if Japan was found to be
  honoring a portion of its semiconductor pact.
      But they also noted that the White House has said it was
  unlikely the tariffs would be lifted before the meeting of the

  U.S.-Japanese economic cooperation, they did serve to blunt 
  Congressional criticism that the Reagan Administrtation was not
  taking tough actions to reduce he U.S. trade deficit.
      Reagan imposed the sanctions on April 17 in retaliation for
  Japan's failure to honor commitments to end dumping
  semiconductors in world markets at less than production costs
  and to open its own market to U.S. goods.
      The sanctions were levied on certain Japanese television

  Ecuador will use a new pipeline link

      The link will be inaugurated on May 8. It was built to
  allow Ecuador to resume exports of crude oil halted on March 5
  by earthquake damage to its Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline,
      Once that pipeline is repaired, Ecuador will exceed its
  OPEC quota in order to offset lost income and pay debts

      The two ministers were speaking at a news conference after

  of the jungle border zone between the two nations. Drilling
  will begin in September.
      ""The agreement to transport Ecuadorean crude oil is not only
  for this emergency period but for the next five years, with
  possibility of an extension. Between 20,000 and 50,000 barrels

  through the link in the next five years, at a cost of 75 cents
  per barrel during the first year.
      The 43-km link, with a maximum capacity of 50,000 bpd, will

['dlr'],"G-7 SEEMS WORRIED MARKETS IGNORE COORDINATION
  Top officials of leading industrial
  nations appear deeply worried that financial markets have
  ignored their efforts to coordinate policies, which they
  believe they strengthened in talks last week.
      Monetary sources said officials were exasperated that the
  markets, which drove the dollar rapidly lower and severely
  disrupted bond and stock markets too, did not take heed of the
  policy commitments of the Group of Seven -- the United States,
  Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
      Treasury Secretary James Baker went out of his way to
  reassure markets of his commitment to a stable dollar with a
  statement, and French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur
  underscored that by saying: ""I don't believe at all that the
  Americans want a weaker dollar.""
      West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the
  dollar's latest rapid descent ""involves the risk -- now already
  a tangible threat -- of a new strong surge of inflation,
  leading to a renewed rise in interest rates.""
      But there were signs too, that while policymakers feared
  the market uproar, they seemed to accept there was little they
  could do until the economic picture changed, and currencies
  settled into a stable pattern as a result.
      Nor did there seem to be any enthusiasm at last week's
  semi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank for higher
  U.S. Interest rates as the best way to curb the dollar's rapid
  descent. That distaste stems in part from fears of recession.
      Outgoing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told
  television interviewers he did not think a policy of driving
  the dollar down would solve the U.S. trade deficit.
      ""It would slow growth in Germany and Japan which would
  adversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it would
  drive interest rates up here which would throw us, if not
  (into) recession, into slower growth,"" he said.
      Asked if higher U.S. Interest rates would stabilize the
  dollar, Balladur said: ""When a currency is maintained
  artificially high, by artificially high interest rates, it is
  not healthy.""
      And resorting to higher interest rates could lead to
  recession, he said.
      Acknowledging the dollar's latest slide was now a fact of
  life, Balladur said, ""there may be adjustments of course in one
  or other currencies, this is not a fixed rate system.""
      But Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker said he
  might rein in credit if the dollar's slide deepens.
      U.S. Monetary sources also said Washington wanted it
  understood by markets the seven's commitments were genuine.
      ""The United States and the six major industrial countries
  are fully committed to implementing our undertakings in these
  agreements,"" Baker told the meetings.
      Darman said Baker had been misinterpreted by markets which
  wrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a further
  decline in the dollar. Baker, Darman said, was committed to
  stabilizing currencies at current levels.
      Last week's statement from the seven reaffirmed a February
  22 agreement in Paris in which the Reagan administration agreed
  to reach a budget deficit compromise with Congress and to fight
  protectionism.
      West Germany and Japan, meanwhile, agreed to stimulate
  domestic demand and lead a global upturn.
      Ministers believed the Paris pact was bolstered by Japan's
  promise of a 35 billion dlr supplementary budget.
      The sources said they believed Baker saw it as a major
  action. But the seven seem to accept their commitment to stable
  currencies applied to today's exchange rates and not those at
  the time of the Paris agreement, when the dollar stood higher.
      The Paris accord said, ""currencies (are) within ranges
  broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals, given
  the policy commitments summarized in this statement.""
      Now they accept the dollar's lower level, especially
  against the yen, as hard reality that is nonetheless consistent
  with the agreement. ""The ministers and governors reaffirmed the
  view that around current levels their currencies are within
  ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals,"" last week's
  statement read.
      Monetary sources said policymakers understood markets were
  focusing on instability created by the gap between the U.S.
  Trade deficit and the surpluses of West Germany and Japan
  rather than prospective policy changes. European monetary
  sources said Bonn was still unconvinced that Washington meant
  business with its commitment to cut the budget deficit.

['trade'],"JAPAN FARM REFORM A KEY TO TRIMMING TRADE SURPLUS
  Basic reform of Japan's protected farm
  sector is a key to shifting its economy away from export to
  domestic-led growth, a vital step if it is to trim its trade
  surplus, securities analysts said.
      The farm sector, which is protected by import tariffs and
  quotas, propped up by subsidies and price supports, and
  sheltered by the tax system, has ample room for change, they
  said.
      ""In economic terms, reform would be a plus,"" said Christopher
  Chew of brokerage firm James Capel and Co.
      The ultimate cost of the existing system is food prices
  twice those in Europe and two to three times those in the U.S.,
  The analysts said.
      Spending on food accounts for about one quarter of the
  average household's budget and roughly 10 pct of the gross
  national product (GNP), according to a study by Chew.
      Reducing these prices could increase household spending
  power by five pct, his study said. The money could be spent on
  products which would have a more direct impact in boosting
  domestic growth, it added.
      ""There's a lot of slack,"" a U.S. Government official in Tokyo
  said. ""All that money could be spent on something else.""
      Direct central government subsidies to the farm sector
  amount to some five billion dlrs per year. Independent
  estimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37
  billion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted.
      Changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farm
  on weekends to put their land up for sale for residential
  development would also give a boost to domestic spending,
  economists said.
      ""Housing construction is the key strategic variable in the
  expansion of domestic demand,"" wrote Chihiro Nakajima, professor
  at Kyoto Gakuen University.
      Japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reform
  to shift some of the burden of trade friction and economic
  restructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto the
  farm sector. Employers groups also want change. ""If you really
  want to expand domestic demand, the way to do it is not to
  raise wages recklessly, but to reduce commodity prices,"" Bumpei
  Otsuki, President of the Japan Federation of Employers'
  Associations told a recent press conference.
      External pressures are rising as the U.S. And Europe seek
  removal of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their trade
  deficits with Japan.
      But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain well
  entrenched, dimming prospects for quick reform, analysts said.
      Although the full-time farm population is falling and there
  are signs the LDP is paying more attention to urban
  constituencies, the ruling party remains heavily dependent on
  farm votes in the rural areas. One rural vote is worth several
  city votes due to the pattern of constituency borders.
      The LDP is already in political trouble over its tax reform
  plan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon,
  the analysts said.
      Consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept the
  traditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay for
  national food security, they said.
      Powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed to
  import liberalisation, but are more flexible about reforms
  aimed at stepping up productivity, they said.
      Reform, when it comes, will be in response to specific
  pressure rather than an all-embracing program, said Chew.

      Of the week's borrowings, money center banks accounted for

      PIW said that that one alternative under consideration is
  to revert to four individual contracts rather than a collective
  agrement.
      John Lichtblau, director of the Petroleum Industry Research
  Foundation Inc said that renegotiation of the pact was more of
  a formality as the Saudis have each company on a separate
  schedule although separate agreements with the companies would
  favor one on one negotiations and ensure that contracted
  liftings occur .
      ""The companies will probably follow the Saudi wants within
  limits as they do not want to antagonize them for the long
  haul,"" he said.
      Lichtblau said that the renegotiations would most likely
  concentrate on volume rather than price.
      Saudi displeasure with the agreement has long been noted
  and in April industry publications said that renegotiation were
  being sought, a fact later confirmed by Reuters with Aramco.
      Aramco Corp was formerly owned by Chevron Corp &lt;CHV>, Exxon

['alum'],"JAPAN APPROVES AID FOR INDONESIA, BRAZIL ALUMINIUM
  Japan's cabinet approved a plan to help
  financially-troubled aluminium ventures in Indonesia and
  Brazil, an official at the Ministry of International and Trade
  Industry (MITI) said.
      Japan will invest 24 billion yen in &lt;PT Indonesia Asahan
  Aluminium> in addition to the 68.3 billion yen already invested
  in the company. The government and private interests will
  equally share the additional investment, he said.
      They will also provide equal shares in 6.3 billion yen in
  new investment in the Albras Amazon aluminium project in
  Brazil, in addition to the 45.7 billion yen already invested.
      The Japan Export-Import Bank will cut its rates on loans to
  Asahan and Albras to about five pct from about seven pct, the
  official said.
      Interest rates on loans by Japan's private banks to the two
  projects are expected to be reduced to around five pct from the
  current seven to eight pct, but an agreement has yet to be
  reached, industry sources said.
      Under the rescue scheme for Asahan, in which 91.1 billion
  yen has been invested, Indonesia will also extend another 32
  billion yen to the company.  This will raise Indonesia's
  investment ratio to about 40 pct from the current 25 pct.
      The Brazilian government has already agreed to invest an
  additional 6.5 billion yen in Albras, in which investment now
  totals 93.2 billion yen, but its stake will not change from 51
  pct, the official said.
      The sources said the rescue programs for the two projects
  were larger than earlier expected, reflecting Japan's desire to
  help develop the economies of Indonesia and Brazil and to
  stabilise sources of aluminium.
      Japan depends on imports for more than 90 pct of its
  aluminium demand, which totals some 1.8 mln tonnes a year, they
  said.

  Goodyear expects to report a profit of more than one dlr a

      Mercer said about seven companies are interested in buying

      Celeron consists of oil and gas reserves and an almost
  complete pipeline linking drilling operations in Santa Barbara,
  Calif., to Texas refineries. Mercer said Celeron's reserves
  would not be sold separately from the pipeline.
      Concerning speculation that two billion dlr price tag for
  Celeron was too high, Mercer said ""There is no fire sale going
  on here and we can continue to keep Celeron as a profitable
  operation throughout the year.""
      Mercer said the expected 1st quarter operating profit was

  Roughly half of this year's expected
  130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground,
  a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in the
  Netherlands, told Reuters.
      Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date
  for the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April
  23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesman
  added.
      ""It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can
  expect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the
  crop is off to a very good start,"" he said.
      Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600
  hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of
  white sugar, substantially more than the country's combined ""A""
  and ""B"" quota of 872,000 tonnes.
      This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been
  introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000
  hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000
  tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota ""C"" sugar produced.
      Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been
  allotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area being
  boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar.

"['corn', 'grain', 'rice']","DRY SPELL IN PHILIPPINES DAMAGES AGRICULTURE CROPS
  A prolonged dry spell has damaged
  111,350 hectares of rice and corn plantations in 10 provinces
  in the central and southern Philippines, agriculture officials
  said.
      They said some 71,070 tonnes of agricultural produce
  estimated at about 250 mln pesos was lost to the lack of
  rainfall. They warned of a severe drought if the prevailing
  conditions continued until next month.
      Agriculture Secretary Carlos Dominguez said he hoped the
  losses would be offset by the expected increase in output in
  other, normally more productive areas not affected by the dry
  spell.
      Affected were 14,030 hectares of palay (unmilled rice),
  representing a production loss of 22,250 tonnes valued at 77.8
  mln pesos, Department of Agriculture reports said.
      About 48,820 tonnes of corn from 97,320 hectares valued at
  170.8 mln pesos have also been lost, they said.
      Officials said the hectarage planted to palay that has been
  hit by the drought accounted for only one pct of national total
  thus the damage is considered negligible.
      In the case of corn, they said the loss can be filled by
  production from non-traditional corn farms which diversified
  into the cash crop from sugar two years ago.
       The Philippine Coconut Authority said coconut production
  in the major producing region of Bicol might drop by 25 pct to
  320,000 tonnes if the dry spell continued. There were no
  reports of actual damage.

      Official sources said the bank, France's sixth largest in
  terms of its deposits and seventh in terms of its assets,
  
  planned a share split to increase the number of shares on offer
  ahead of the sale of 40 pct of its ordinary share capital to

      Previously one of France's biggest private banks, it was
  nationalised by the Socialists in 1982.
      The sources said it was too early to give details of the
  planned split or of the share price, but cited April 27 as a
  likely date for the flotation launch.
      So far 30 pct of the group's capital, currently at 10.33
  mln shares of 100 francs nominal, has been offered for sale to
  large private investors to constitute a solid core of eight to
  ten shareholders before the flotation.

      ""I expect the meeting in Vienna to be short and calm,""

  ahead of his departure on Sunday for the conference, which
  starts June 25.
      ""We already have an agreement which may need only a slight

      The agreement reached at a long session of OPEC ministers
  in December last year pegged the group's crude oil output at
  15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 at fixed prices of around 18
  dlrs a barrel.
      Since then prices have risen from 15 dlrs in December to
  just above the official OPEC levels, with oil industry analysts
  firmly convinced the organisation will maintain the agreement
  to keep the market stable.
      ""I myself believe that OPEC will tend to take a position to

      He declined to say if the current ceiling should be

  value was not reflected in the company's stock price.
      Industry analyst Richard Pzena of Sanford C. Bernstein said
  the unit had operating earnings of 132 mln dlrs last year and

  three billion dlrs, putting the 20 pct interest at around 500
  to 600 mln dlrs.
      Pzena said he thought the company was selling the stake
  because chemical margins had peaked, and he speculated the
  company would use the proceeds to pay down debt.

  The Securities and Exchange
  Commission charged Allied Stores Corp with failing to promptly
  disclose key steps it was taking last September to thwart a
  takeover attempt by Campeau Corp.
      In an administrative complaint, the SEC said Allied and its
  legal adviser failed to promptly inform shareholders and the
  agency that it had begun talks with Youngstown, Ohio, shopping
  center developer Edward DeBartolo in response to Campeau's
  takeover offer.
      Campeau acquired Allied for an estimated 4.2 billion dlrs
  on Jan 1, following a battle with DeBartolo.
      On Sept 25, a day after Allied disclosed that its board had
  urged rejection of Campeau's Sept 12 tender offer for 58 dlrs a
  share, Allied began negotiating the sale of six shopping
  centers to DeBartolo, the SEC said.
      Allied legal advisor and director George Kern, who heads
  the merger and acquisitions group at the New York law firm of
  Sullivan and Cromwell, decided against amending Allied's SEC
  filing to disclose the talks even though they had resulted in
  sales price of 405 mln dlrs for the shopping centers, it said.
      Securities law requires takeover target companies to
  promptly disclose such things as the sale of major assets.
      The day after Campeau increased its tender offer to 80 pct
  of Allied's stock from 55 pct and raised its bid to 66 dlrs a
  share from 58 dlrs on Sept 29, Allied and a partnership headed
  by DeBartolo began negotiating a takeover deal aimed at
  thwarting Campeau, the SEC said.
      Kern again decided against disclosing the talks in an
  amended SEC filing, the agency charged.
      Allied's first disclosure of the DeBartolo takeover was
  made on Oct 8, even though its board approved the merger on Oct
  3 and the merger agreement was executed on Oct 7, the complaint
  said.
      DeBartolo and Campeau later engaged in a bitter battle for
  control of Allied, with Campeau winning out later in October
  when it bought a block of 25.8 mln shares of Allied stock, or
  48 pct of the total, in a controversial move made only minutes
  after it dropped its hostile tender offer.
      The acquisition of the additional 48 pct, which a federal
  judge allowed to be completed, gave Campeau a majority stake in
  Allied. Campeau bought the rest at 69 dlrs a share.
      The SEC said it had planned to file a court brief joining
  with Allied in charging that Campeau had engaged in an illegal
  tender offer.
      But the SEC brief was never filed since the case was
  dropped following an agreement between Campeau and DeBartolo.
      In the administrative proceeding against Allied and Kern,
  the SEC is asking for an administrative order that they comply
  with reporting provisions of securities laws in the future.
      Although Allied is no longer publicly traded since it
  became a subsidiary of Campeau, it still files annual and
  quarterly reports to the SEC because it has outstanding debt.

      The ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim, had prevented

      The pay dispute went before a hearing of the Arbitration

['crude'],"US RULED OUT ATTACK ON IRANIAN SILKWORMS
  U.S. military planners ruled out
  Iran's Silkworm missiles as a target in the retaliatory attack
  mounted on Monday for fear of being drawn more deeply into the
  Iran-Iraq war, defense and Middle East experts said.
      U.S. naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform and
  raided another in what the administration called a ""measured and
  appropriate response"" to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack last
  Friday on a U.S.-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters.
      Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rig
  rather than an onshore economic or military target such as
  Silkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington to
  limit the political, military and diplomatic fallout both at
  home and in the Gulf.
      ""It simply demonstrated the United States will take military
  action when they (Iran) take military action,"" Norman Polmar, a
  defense analyst and author, said.
      He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran the
  embarrassment of casualties on its own soil, possibly avoiding
  an escalating spiral of attack and counterattack.
      In addition, it minimized the risk to U.S. forces and the
  potential embarrassment of any losses, including aircraft that
  could have been shot down had they taken part in an attack.
      Anthony Cordesman, author of a new book on the Iran-Iraq
  war, said the United States apparently chose a limited target
  to keep alive the possibility that U.N. Secretary General
  Javier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept a
  Security Council call for a ceasefire.
      ""We want the U.N. peace initiative to work if there's any
  chance at all,"" he said, adding that the action made it clear
  tougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping.
  
     In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagon
  to have been turned into a military command post -- Washington
  also sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran's
  economic lifeline. Pentagon officials said the platform had
  been used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in the
  lower Gulf.
      ""We have chosen a military target, but we also have shown
  Iran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exporting
  capabilities,"" Cordesman said.
      He predicted the United States would respond to any future
  major Iranian challenges by hitting Iran's naval base at Bandar
  Abbas on the Straits of Hormuz, followed by mining the
  approaches to Iran's oil export terminal on Kharg Island.
      Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Monday the
  United States did not seek further confrontation with Iran, ""but
  we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action
  by Iran with stronger countermeasures.""

  American lawmakers rallied behind

      The Pentagon announced on Monday that U.S. warships
  destroyed a non-producing oil platform used for monitoring Gulf
  ship traffic and military operations, and also raided a second
  Iranian oil rig in retaliation for an earlier Iranian attack on
  a Kuwaiti ship flying the American flag.
      Many Democrats, who control Congress, and Republicans
  expressed support for the attack and praised it as an
  appropriate ""measured response.""
      But Democrats and liberal Republicans voiced new fears that
  the growing confrontation between Tehran and the United States
  could erupt into a major war, and demanded that Reagan comply
  with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead to a pullout of
  American forces from the waterway.
      ""Those who contend the strike was necessary must realize
  their words are easily construed as a tacit endorsement of war
  with Iran,"" said Sen Mark Hatfield of Oregon, a Republican.

  share bid by CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S>.
      Alternatively, ETL will offer three shares plus 82 cents
  cash for each Monier share, it said in a statement.
      As previously reported, ETL moved into the market for
  Monier shares last week, taking its stake to 13.7 pct by
  Friday.
      It now holds 14.99 pct, the maximum allowed without Foreign
  Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval. ETL is classified as
  foreign because of its New Zealand base.
      The ETL cash offer values Monier's issued capital of 156.28
  mln shares at 649 mln dlrs, against 593 mln for the CSR bid.
      Based on the current price of ETL shares of 1.05 dlrs, the
  alternative is worth 3.97 dlrs per share, but ETL said the
  value placed on its shares for the offer aproximates to the
  diluted asset backing of ETL as at March 31.
      ETL said the offer will have no minimum acceptance
  conditions and will be subject to Australian foreign investment
  and U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust clearances.
      ETL chairman Allan Hawkins said in the statement that the
  shareholding in Monier was a long term investment.
      ETL and its &lt;Feltex International Ltd> associate have
  targetted the building products sector as an area of expansion
  and Monier fits well with this aim, he added.
      Monier chairman Bill Locke said in a separate statement
  that the independent directors of Monier intend to recommend
  acceptance of the ETL bid in the absence of a higher bid.
      He also said Monier will not now proceed with the
  one-for-two bonus issue announced with its interim results on
  March 19 in view of the proposed takeover bids.

"['alum', 'palm-oil', 'tin', 'veg-oil']","MALAYSIA TO RESEARCH TIN, WARY ON VEG OILS TAX
  Malaysia is to urge fellow tin
  producing countries to contribute more money towards research
  into new uses for the metal, Malaysian primary industries
  minister Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in an interview.
      Lim, in Brussels on a tour of Europe and America, said he
  had instructed Malaysia's representatives on the executive
  committee of the Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC,
  to draw up a paper on the matter.
      Lim earlier met European Community farm commissioner Frans
  Andriessen and industry commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes.
      He said though it now appeared likely Commission proposals
  for a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats would be
  defeated, he feared the Commission would revive the idea.
      Lim noted Andriessen this week promised that if the tax was
  adopted and third countries suffered export losses as a result,
  they would be compensated through access to the EC for
  alternative exports.
      ""Since most of our products are commodity based, I cannot
  see how this would work out in our case,"" Lim said.
      Malaysian palm oil exports to the EC are worth about 250
  mln dlrs a year.
      The tin research proposal would be presented at an ATPC
  meeting to be held in Kuala Lumpur in September.
      ""Not enough research and development effort has been put in
  by tin producers and we have been pushed out by substitutes
  such as aluminium, paper and plastics,"" Lim said.
      He mentioned the use of inorganic tin in pesticides as an
  exciting possible new application.
      Lim said he could not estimate the amount of extra money
  which needed to be spent on research into new uses before the
  new paper was produced.
      He said Narjes told him there appeared no fundamental
  barriers to EC states quickly ratifying the new International
  Rubber Agreement, INRA, although translations of the accord
  into some EC languages are still being awaited.
      Lim, who will sign and ratify the agreement on Malaysia's
  behalf when he visits New York during his current tour, said it
  was important there should not be a long ""interregnum"" between
  the old agreement lapsing in October and the new one coming
  into force.
      He described the present accord as a model for commodity
  agreements due to its being signed by nearly all producing and
  consuming countries and by virtue of its review systems and
  control over buffer stock management.

['earn'],"J.P. MORGAN &lt;JPM> NET HURT BY BRAZIL, TRADING
  J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its
  first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its
  previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status
  its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil.
      That decision, spurred by Brazil's suspension of interest
  payments on February 20, reduced the quarter's net income by 20
  mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the
  first three months of 1986.
      Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities
  underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln
  dlrs in the year-earlier period.
      In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading
  losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and
  underwriting of Euromarket securities.
      Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained
  difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering
  heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether
  Morgan's trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket.
      On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan
  losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign
  exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and
  trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln.
      Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and
  commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net
  investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln.
      Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first
  quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell
  to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct.
      If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means
  that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are
  actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9
  mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume
  payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added.
      After the provision for loan losses, Morgan's allowance for
  credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared
  with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier.
      It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after
  charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49
  mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier.
      Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter's end were
  583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year
  earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from
  303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to

['rubber'],"RUBBER STOCK MANAGER SAYS QUALITY ACCEPTABLE
  International Rubber Organisation
  (INRO) buffer stock manager Aldo Hofmeister said tests had
  shown the quality of rubber in stock was acceptable, but
  acknowledged that some consumers were now wary of buying it.
      ""We have said all along that the rubber is holding up well
  from a condition and quality standpoint...Rubber stored in
  proper conditions does not deteriorate,"" he told Reuters in a
  telephone interview. The quality of buffer stock rubber sold
  since he entered the market in September would be discussed at
  an INRO Council meeting which opened here today, he said.
      Tokyo traders said on Friday they had little interest in
  buying rubber from the INRO buffer stock because of possible
  poor quality.
      Hofmeister began selling rubber when prices exceeded the
  ""may-sell' level of 232 cents per kg early last month. INRO's
  five-day moving average was quoted at 237.3 cents on October
  16. He said the quality of five to six-year old rubber in stock
  was uppermost in consumers' minds.
      ""We have received good interest for the rubber. I understand
  the Japanese concern. Many consumers want to try the rubber
  before they carry on buying,"" he said.
      Hofmeister said INRO rubber was stored in 28 different
  locations in producing and consuming nations, adding all
  warehouses used were suitable for long-term storage.
      Selling of buffer stock rubber had levelled off during the
  past week to 10 days and this could reflect a ""wait and see
  attitude"" by buyers, he said.
      ""Consumers are holding back from buying additional amounts
  until they test out the rubber. If their tests are positiive,
  they are likely to buy more."" Hofmeister said he could reduce
  the offer price of buffer stock rubber to stimulate interest
  but INRO did not want to depress prices artificially.
      Hofmeister declined to comment on Japanese trade estimates
  that he had sold around 30,000 to 32,000 tonnes in Kuala Lumpur
  and New York since September.
      But he said Japanese traders were in a position to have an
  idea of the quantity he had sold, noting that traders overall
  had put buffer stock sales at between 25,000 and 35,000 tonnes.
      The question of sales from the original 360,000 tonne
  buffer stock is expected to be the main topic of the Council
  meeting which is scheduled to end on Thursday.
      The current international rubber pact expires on October
  22.
      The deadline for the new pact's start is January 1989 and
  Hofmeister has been mandated to continue selling rubber during
  the interim period.

  France's growth rate is expected to
  strengthen in the second half of this year after a poor first
  half, but unemployment will worsen, the Organisation for
  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.
      In its semi-annual review of the world economy, the OECD
  forecast that growth in the French Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
  would run at about two pct in the next six months. It said the
  rate would be in line with the 1986 trends, but significantly
  higher than in the first half of this year.
      The OECD said France's economic situation has deteriorated
  somewhat during the early months of 1987. 
      Activity has slowed, primarily reflecting an inventory
  adjustment, while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflation
  has reaccelerated, the OECD said. Unemployment is likely to
  reach 12 pct of the workforce by the end of 1988.
      The report said inflation should slow and domestic demand
  pick up in the second half of this year. But both data are
  likely to be worse than those recorded in 1986, it added.
      The OECD forecast a 2.75 pct rise in consumer prices for
  the second half of this year, a one pct drop from the first six
  months. The slowdown would bring the inflation rate to 3.25 pct
  for the whole year, sharply up from last year's 2.2 pct.

      ""Today's CD buying operation was designed to seek an

      The bank also bought 400 billion yen in two-month

      The central bank was concerned about growing market
  expectations of higher interest rates, which were in part
  responsible for the recent plunge in stock and yen bond prices,
  the officials said.

  the bank's CD operation because it was small and at a rate far

['veg-oil'],"EC COMMISSION DEFENDS OILS AND FATS TAX
  A spokesman for the European
  Community Commission defended the controversial plan for a levy
  on oils and fats, saying that consumers would have to help
  alleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax.
      Norbert Tanghe, head of division of the Commission's
  Directorate General for Agriculture, told the 8th Antwerp Oils
  and Fats Contact Days ""the Commission firmly believes that the
  sacrifices which would be undergone by Community producers in
  the oils and fats sector ... Would justify asking consumers to
  make an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem
  within that sector by paying a levy.""
      The proposed tax is necessary because the level of
  budgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds
  production has become unacceptable, Tanghe said.
      Recent estimates put these costs at 4.0 billion European
  Currency Units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2.0
  billion Ecus, he said. In 1990 the Community's ""standstill""
  agreements with Spain and Portugal end and the EC would then
  feel the full impact of its enlargement.
      The Commission has proposed several cost and production
  cutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum
  guaranteed quantity system, he added.
      Under the Commission's system for stabilising consumer
  prices in the oils and fats sector, a reference price of 700
  Ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced, Tanghe
  said.
      Consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory
  amount when market prices are below or above this level.
      He said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory
  amount would be used to finance the Common Agricultural
  Policy's oils and fats regime.
      ""The Commission believes that hostile reactions (to the
  proposed tax) have for the most part been based on incomplete
  or an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal,"" he said.
      Tanghe said the proposed system conforms with General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, rules.
      It would not be discriminatory because it would be applied
  to domestic and imported products, and past experience showed
  it would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats.
      EC-produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do
  under present aid arrangements, he said.
      The competitiveness between different oils, whether EC
  produced or imported, would remain unchanged and quantities
  imported from third countries would not be affected by the tax,
  Tanghe said.
      The proposed system would not alter the EC nations'
  requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall
  effect would stabilise Community production levels without
  affecting demand, he said.
      It is one of the proposal's objectives to maintain current
  import levels, he said.
      Imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are
  imported primarily to satisfy the EC's cakes and meals
  requirements, which are not covered by the stabilising system.
  Furthermore, more than half the oil produced from imported
  beans is re-exported to third countries, Tanghe added.

  Recent announcements from Moscow of
  next year's grain production targets indicate that the Soviets
  are estimating this year's grain crop at 205 to 213 mln tonnes,
  Agriculture Department analysts said.
      USDA is projecting the Soviet crop at 210 mln tonnes, but
  some earlier estimates from Soviet officials were that the 1987
  grain crop could match the 1978 record of 237 mln tonnes.
      Moscow outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday,
  putting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln tonnes. An analyst of
  Soviet agriculture at USDA noted that a recent article in
  Izvestia said Soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to be
  ""25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year.""
      ""This indicates that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213
  mln tonne (grain) crop,"" the analyst said.
     
      In calculating Moscow's crop estimate, USDA used the 235
  mln tonne production goal, as well as a 238 mln tonne figure
  published in a Soviet economic journal this month.
      USDA's production estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects a
  range of 207 to 212 mln tonnes, a USDA source said.
      Late season rains damaged Soviet crops, slowed harvest
  progress and lowered Soviet production, analysts said.
      While in the U.S. earlier this month, Soviet agriculture
  official Viktor Nikonov predicted that the grain crop would be
  as good or better than last year's 210 mln tonne harvest.
      A member of Nikonov's party commented that although 230 mln
  tonnes of grain were in the fields, harvest problems would
  bring the final crop down to around 210 mln tonnes.

  Proven oil and gas deposits in Saudi
  Arabia increased in 1986 despite higher oil output, according
  to the kingdom's main producing company, Aramco.
      Recoverable oil reserves in Aramco fields rose to 167
  billion barrels by the end the year from 166.5 billion in 1985,
  while gas reserves jumped by 7.7 pct to 135.8 trillion cu ft
  from 126.1 trillion, the company's annual report said.
      Aramco, responsible for all Saudi production except about
  200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the Neutral Zone between Saudi
  Arabia and Kuwait, increased production to 4.69 mln barrels per
  day in 1986 from 3.04 mln barrels a year earlier.
  
      Most of 1986 was a virtual free-for-all in production, as
  OPEC members abandoned restraint in an effort to recapture
  their share of the market. In the process, prices collapsed
  from about 28 dlrs a barrel to below nine dlrs, until the
  organisation decided to cut production again from last
  September onwards.
      Saudi output in 1985 had been the lowest since the 1960s.
      Production of natural gas liquids in 1986 declined slightly
  to 304,178 bpd from 316,310, said the report, carried on the
  official Saudi Press Agency.
      The increase in reserves came despite a sharp cut in the
  number of wells Aramco drilled to 33 in 1986 from 103 in 1985.
  
      Aramco's only refinery, at Ras Tannurah, processed 142.44
  mln barrels (390,246 bpd) of crude last year. The plant was
  upgraded to a capacity of 530,000 bpd during the year, enabling
  it to supply 50 pct of local demand for oil products, the
  report said.
      The country's other five, smaller refineries -- owned by
  another state-owned oil organisation, Petromin -- produced
  around 750,000 bpd last year.
  
      Sulphur production rose to 1.23 mln tonnes in 1986 from
  998,707 tonnes in 1985. During the year the company began
  operating a sulphur granule plant with capacity of 4,000 tonnes

  Italy's barley crop is generally in good

  agricultural marketing information and research board Irvam
  said.
      First consignments were expected to be available around
  mid-June.
      Excellent weather, characterised by alternating periods of
  sunshine and rain, has encouraged growth except in Sardinia,
  which was expected to lose a large part of its barley crop
  because of extreme dryness.
      Irvam said yields are expected higher than last year's low
  levels if favourable weather continues in the next few weeks.
      Given an average yield of 3.5 tonnes per hectare, national
  production would be around two pct higher than in the previous
  season at just above 1.6 mln tonnes, it said.
      If yields reach the record 3.78 tonnes per hectare achieved

"['dlr', 'money-fx', 'money-supply']","FED DATA SUGGEST NO CHANGE IN MONETARY POLICY
  New U.S. Banking data suggest the
  Federal Reserve is guiding monetary policy along a steady path
  and is not signalling any imminent change of course, economists
  said.
      But they also said that if money supply growth remains
  weak, as this week's unexpected eight billion dlr M-1 decline
  suggests it may, this could influence the Fed to loosen its
  credit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetary
  policy.
      A Reuter survey of 17 money market economists produced a
  forecast of a 600 mln dlr M-1 decline for the week ended June
  8, with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to a
  decline of four billion. Instead, M-1 fell eight billion dlrs
  to 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.
      Coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in M-1 for
  the week ended June 1, this means the nation's money supply has
  fallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks,
  economists said.
      ""M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness,"" said Bill Sullivan
  of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
      While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator of
  economic growth, Sullivan said Fed officials might be concerned
  the latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growth
  in the broader monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, which are seen
  as better gauges of economic growth.
      Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May, both
  measures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed's
  5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges.
      If money growth does not accelerate, Fed officials,
  concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging,
  could turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said.
      ""Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current open
  market position? No,"" Sullivan said. ""But does this mean the end
  of tightening for the time being? Definitely yes.""
      Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings
  of 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement period
  were lower than they had expected. Most believed the Fed had
  targetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs.
      But they said that if it had not been for a large one-day
  net miss in the Fed's reserve projections, the higher
  borrowings target would probably have been reached.
      A drop in May U.S. Housing starts and continued weakness in
  auto sales show key sectors of the U.S. Economy are lagging,
  while a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in May producer prices has
  helped dispel inflation fears, Slifer said.
      ""If this continues, we can entertain the notion of Fed
  easing at some point,"" he said.
      Other economists said the Fed would probably pay little
  attention to weak money supply growth. ""It has been a number of
  years since M-1 has given good signs of what's going on in the
  economy,"" one said. ""I don't think M-1 shows that the economy is
  falling apart and the Fed should ease.""
      Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be a
  prerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetary
  policy.
      They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term rates
  for fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar and
  higher inflation which would push up long-term yields and choke
  off econmomic growth.
      But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late
  April. ""The Fed has to determine if this represents a
  fundamental change for the dollar. If it does, then this gives
  them more room to ease,"" he said.

['carcass'],"CHICKEN NOT MAIN SALMONELLA CAUSE, OFFICIAL SAYS
  A representative of the poultry
  industry said statistics showed that chicken is less frequently
  the cause of salmonella poisoning than beef, dairy products or
  salads and other mixed foods.
      Kenneth May, President of Holly Farms Poultry Industries
  and a director of the National Broiler Council, told a House
  Agriculture subcommittee the incidence of salmonella in chicken
  has not increased in recent years and that chicken is neither
  the major source of the bacterial poisoning nor the cause of an
  increase in outbreaks of the disease.
      May said the Center for Disease Control figures showed that
  between 1978 and 1982, chicken was involved in four pct of all
  U.S. salmonellosis outbreaks, while beef accounted for ten pct
  of outbreaks and dairy products six pct.
      May said the remaining outbreaks were caused by salads and
  mixed food, turkey, seafood, pork, eggs and other foods.
      May said the chicken industry favored moving away from
  bird-by-bird inspection procedures to a risk assessment system
  better able to identify microbial and bacterial contamination
  of poultry.
      However, Ellen Haas, executive director of Public Voice for
  Food and Health Policy, said bird-by-bird inspection should be
  retained and labels should be attached to each ready-to-cook
  chicken to remind consumers about preparation procedures
  necessary to avoid illness.
      Haas also called for a review of present chicken industry
  inspection methods that she said can worsen poultry hazards.

"['money-fx', 'nzdlr']","NEW ZEALAND BUDGET FORECAST SEEN AS POSITIVE
  Analysts said they were surprised at
  the government's announcement of a forecast budget surplus for
  fiscal 1988 but said it was consistent with previous policy
  statements and positive for the economy.
      Finance Minister Roger Douglas predicted a budget surplus
  for the year ending March 1988 of 379 mln New Zealand dlrs
  against a 1.95 billion deficit last year.
      Analysts polled by Reuters said the forecast budget surplus
  was even more positive than the most bullish analysts'
  forecasts and that this was good news for financial markets.
      Market expectations among analysts questioned by Reuters
  before the budget varied widely between a balanced budget and a
  2.3 billion dlr deficit. But none predicted a surplus.
      The forecast initially looks positive for both the bond and
  the foreign exchange markets, one analyst said. Paradoxically,
  the New Zealand dollar could rise in the medium term, despite
  lower interest rates, as overseas investors became more
  confident about investing in New Zealand, he said.
      However, some foreign exchange dealers disagreed, saying
  the local dollar is primarily interest rate driven and will
  move lower.
      The local dollar dropped to 0.5940/50 U.S. Dlrs in after
  hours trading, against 0.5970/77 just before the budget
  release.
      Analysts said the budget was also positive for the share
  market, despite an increase in the contribution of company
  taxation to revenue figures.
      One equities analyst predicted that the budget surplus
  announcement could push the share market up by 50 points
  tomorrow.
      The Budget statement was broadly as expected, with a
  continuation of existing policies, and the absence of
  traditional pre-election incentives would be viewed positively
  by overseas investors, another said.
      But one merchant bank economist said that certain anti-tax
  avoidance measures could damage some sectors of the share
  market, particularly multi-national companies.
      The government is also lowering its borrowing requirements,
  through bond tenders, as a result of the surplus. The
  requirement for the rest of the year is now down to 950 mln
  N.Z. Dlrs from a predicted 1.75 billion.
      Predicted revenue in the Budget looked sustainable and
  there appeared to be no holding back on expenditure, another
  economist said. He added that the document seemed entirely
  credible.
      ""Altogether it looks good for Labour's election prospects,""
  he said.
      An election is due before the end of September.

  Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
  said the ruling of a GATT panel on a U.S. trade complaint
  against Japan, expected soon, may influence the U.S. stance in
  negotiations with Tokyo on beef and citrus import quotas.
      The ruling of a GATT tribunal on a U.S. demand that Japan
  end quotas on 12 categories of food items is expected by the
  end of the year. Lyng said he is optimistic the ruling will
  favor the U.S.
      ""These are quota items, and the principles that apply to
  them, it seems to me, will have some bearing on the question of
  whether you would have quotas or not on beef and citrus,"" Lyng
  told Reuters in an interview.
      He repeated the U.S. demand that Japan lift the quotas on
  beef and citrus after March 31, next year.
      The Japanese quotas on 12 food categories which the United
  States has challenged include items such as tomato paste, some
  cheeses and specialty fruit juices.
      U.S. officials had hoped a ruling against the quotas would
  be issued earlier this year but the GATT panel decision has
  been delayed by the illness of the tribunal's chairman.
      The U.S. has taken a hardline stance on the beef and citrus
  quotas, which Tokyo says must remain in place to protect
  Japanese farmers.
      ""We will not negotiate new quotas or accept new quotas (on
  beef and citrus). If they impose them we would consider that an
  illegal action in the GATT, Lyng said.
      He declined to say what action the U.S. would take next

  reached with international creditors in March as evidence of
  improved foreign perceptions of the South African economy.
      The accord effectively extends a moratorium on most
  repayments of 13 billion dlrs of South Africa's short term
  foreign debt. Total foreign debt is 23 billion dlrs.
      South Africa recorded a seasonally adjusted annualised
  surplus on the current account of the balance of payments of
  7.43 billion rand in the first quarter, compared with a surplus
  of 7.24 billion rand in 1986. The bank said it was the ninth
  consecutive current account surplus since the start of 1985.

"['meal-feed', 'oilseed', 'soy-meal', 'soybean']","SOYCOMPLEX COULD RALLY ON TIGHT U.S. FEED SUPPLY
  Nearby months in soybean and soymeal
  futures could post a short-term rally on tightening supply of
  livestock feed, even if favorable growing conditions keep the
  new crop outlook bearish, traders said.
      ""A lot of soymeal dealers are just getting very worried
  about where processors will get their soybeans this Summer,""
  one Illinois soyproduct dealer said.
      Processors are competing vigorously with river dealers for
  the few soybeans being offered by country elevators, with a
  Decatur, Illinois processor raising its spot soybean basis bid
  another two cents today to 10 over July futures.
      Farmer marketings of old crop soybeans continue very light,
  with flat prices apparently well below levels they are willing
  to sell, dealers said.
      Some terminal elevator operators are coming to the belief
  that even if futures rally back to last month's highs, country
  movement may remain light because farmers in many areas are
  sold out of old crop soybeans, particularly in the eastern half
  of the Midwest.
      Soybean processors will continue to take seasonal downtime
  for maintenance if soybeans remain difficult to buy, reducing
  the weekly soybean crush rate still further and keeping the
  spot soymeal basis strong, dealers said.
      Futures traders said tight cash supplies should help July
  soybeans and soymeal gain on deferreds. July soymeal has
  already moved to a premium over the August through October
  months and old crop July/new crop November soybeans may also
  move to a July premium later this month, they added.

      These conditions are that offers from registered companies
  should be in pounds sterling for cocoa beans for which standard
  differentials have been set in the ICCO's buffer stock rules,
  and can be for cocoa afloat through to December shipment and
  spot to December arrival/delivery.
      The basis position will be afloat, May/July shipment or

      The deadline for the receipt of offers by the manager shall
  be 1330 hrs london time (1230 gmt) in the case of offers
  emanating from the secondhand market and 1400 hours in the case
  of offers emanating from the origins.
      The competitiveness of offers will be assessed by taking
  into account the standard differentials, the cost of taking
  cocoa into store (currently 23.00 pounds sterling from ""cif

  Investor Paul Bilzerian said if Pay N'
  Pak Stores Inc enters into a merger accord with him he will
  immediately begin a tender offer for 7.5 mln shares for 20 dlrs
  per share in cash.
      Bilzerian told Reuters he believes his offer is superior to
  a leveraged buyout proposal disclosed in an announcement by the
  company this morning.
      The company said it is evaluating both proposals.
  Bilizerian said he was optimistic his offer will be accepted at
  a meeting of the board of directors Wednesday. Officials of Pay
  N' Pak did were not immediately available for comment.
   
      Bilzerian said he has a pool of 150 mln dlrs raised by
  Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc available for the tender and ""we
  may add a bank to that.""
      ""We've submitted an agreement we're prepared to sign,"" he
  said. Shares not accepted in Bilzerian's tender would be
  exchangeable for 20 dlrs in convertible preferred stock.
      Asked what would happen if the leveraged buyout group,
  which the company did not identify, topped his offer between
  now and the board meeting, Bilzerian said he expected an
  opportunity to respond.
      Pay N' Pak gave no details about the buyout group, but did
  say the offer was contingent on financing and on an agrreement
  regarding management's equity participation.
      Bilzerian said it was his understanding that the management
  particpation was ""nominal.""
      Pay N' Pak fell 1-1/2 to 19. Arbitrageurs said there was
  disappointment that neither of the offers topped 20 dlrs.
      ""We were expecting an offer north of (above) 21 or 22
  dlrs,"" said one arbitrageur. The leveraged buyout plan was for
  17.50 dlrs per share in cash and 2.50 dlrs in 13-1/2 pct
  cumulative preferred stock.
  
      Robert Cheadle, analyst at Montgomery Securities, said ""you
  have to ask yourself why no one in the industry made a bid.""
      Scott Drysdale, analyst at Birr Wilson Securities, said the
  company has not made the best strategic moves over the years.
  ""They have not done the right things at the right time,"" he
  said, and as a result earnings per share have steadily declined
  since 1984. The 57 cts per share in earnings reported for the
  fiscal year ended in February was lower than 1978's earnings,
  he said. Earnings totaled 5.7 mln dlrs on revenue of 398.4 mln
  dlrs.
      Drysdale said Pay N' Pak has better trained sales people
  than many competitors, but it competes on price even though
  competitors have lower costs. The result is squeezed margins.
  He noted that there have been no other publicly identified
  bidders stepping forward since the company rejected an earlier
  Bilzerian proposal in mid-April.
      Another arbitrageur said it might not be too late for
  another bidder to get in the game. He speculated that someone
  in the same home improvement business might be able to offer a
  deal for stock that would top both the buyout proposal and
  Bilzerian's plan.

  International Business Machines Corp
  has started the year aggressively, but industry analysts said
  the company still faces some tough rounds in its fight to stop

  have been in a long time,"" said PaineWebber analyst Stephen
  Smith.
      ""But they're not out of the woods yet,"" he added.
      At 1.30 dlrs a share, IBM's first-quarter net income easily
  topped most estimates on Wall Street, which had ranged from an
  even dollar to 1.20 dlrs.
      Most analysts said they were pleasantly surprised by IBM's
  performance. But they indicated that IBM's chances for a full
  recovery hinged on several key factors whose impact will not be
  felt until later in the year.
      These include the success of IBM's new personal computer
  line, introduced two weeks ago, and its 9370 minicomputers,
  which will begin volume shipments in July.
      In addition, IBM has said the full benefits of its
  early-retirement program and other cost-cutting moves will
  emerge as the year progresses.
      Analysts noted that IBM chairman John F. Akers was
  relatively more upbeat in assessing the company's outlook than
  he has been for nearly a year.
      ""Although the worldwide economic situation remains
  unsettled, there are some encouraging signs in our business,""
  Akers said, pointing to, among other things, higher
  first-quarter shipments. ""We remain optimistic about the
  prospects for both the industry and IBM,"" he said.
      ""Akers was most encouraging,"" said PaineWebber's Smith.
      A weak dollar, a lower tax rate and strong mainframe
  computer sales all contributed to the better-than-expected
  first-quarter results, analysts said.
      ""Shipments of the 3090 mainframes were very strong in
  March,"" after a weak January and February, said Ulric Weil of
  Washington-based Weil and Associates.
      Sales of the top-of-the-line mainframes, commonly called
  the Sierras, ""bailed out the whole quarter,"" Weil said, adding,
  ""If this continues, it augers well for the rest of the year.""

  Flooding in the Red River on the
  Texas/Oklahoma border has shut down the Basin Pipeline, a
  24-inch pipeline that transports as much as 300,000 barrels per
  day of sweet and sour crudes from Texas to Cushing, Okla, a
  Texaco Pipeline Co spokesman confirmed.
      ""The water is rushing by so fast that we can't get any
  divers down to assess the damage but there is some possibility
  that the pipeline could be up by the end of the week,"" a company
  source said.
      The pipeline transmits roughly two-thirds sour crude and
  one-third sweet crude oil from the Midland, Texas region.
      Texaco sources said that if the pipeline service is
  restored by Friday there would be little problem in restoring
  oil which has been lost to the flood.
      ""But if the pipeline is down more than 10 days it will be
  difficult to make up without prorationing and we would not like
  to proration this pipeline, if we don't have to.""
      The Basin Pipeline is jointly owned by Atlantic Richfield
  Corp &lt;ARC>, Shell Oil Co, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell
  Group &lt;RD> and Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, which is the pipeline's
  operator.
       Peter Beutel, analyst at Elders Futures Inc, said crude
  oil futures contracts on New York Mercantile Exchange rose to
  new highs this afternoon following news of the pipeline break.
      July crude futures of West Texas Intermediate traded up to
  19.60 dlrs a barrel, a rise of more than 20 cts.
      Cash market prices also firmed on the news with sellers of
  WTI raising offers to 19.60 dlrs a barrel.
      Sour crudes, which would be most affected by the pipeline
  shutdown, however, were slow to react to the news with West
  Texas Sour and Alaska North Slope holding 50 cts to one dlr a
  barrel below WTI, respectively.
      Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at
  Texaco, said the company hopes to fix the pipeline in five days
  but that will depend on when the water level of the Red River
  recedes. There is already evidence that the water level is
  dropping and it appears the rain has stopped in the area
  affecting the pipeline, Stevens said.
      He said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged was
  underground and at a distance from the Red River that flooded.
  The pipeline runs over the Red River and under the subsoil
  nearby, according to Stevens. He said some of this subsoil was
  apparently washed away.
     
      The potential for environmental damage is being downplayed
  at this time despite the volume of oil that runs through this
  line.
      Texaco's Stevens said that aerial surveillance has not
  found any crude on the water in the river or in Lake Texoma,
  which is nearby.

  Soviet Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told
  the Supreme Soviet (parliament) industrial output is planned to
  rise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from a planned 4.4 pct in 1987.
      In the first nine months of this year, industrial output
  rose by 3.6 pct.
      Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalent
  to gross national product, is planned to rise by 4.3 pct
  against a planned 4.1 pct this year.
      He said grain production is planned at 235 mln tonnes in
  1988, compared with a planned 232 mln this year.
      The Soviet Union produced 210 mln tonnes of grain in 1986
  and the Soviet press has said heavy rain has affected the
  harvest this year.
      Talyzin said the 1988 Soviet plan stressed the engineering
  industry, which Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described
  as a sector where rapid modernisation is essential if the
  Soviet Union is to compete effectively on world markets.
      ""Certain difficulties have arisen this year in the
  machine-building industry. The economy is not receiving a
  considerable amount of the equipment that it requires,"" said
  Talyzin, who heads the state planning committee Gosplan.
      Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makes
  machine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,
  increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of this
  year against the same period of 1986. This is well below the
  7.3 pct rise planned for the industry for all of 1988.
      Talyzin said the ruling Politburo concluded at a recent
  meeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to
  a large extent on conserving resources better. ""Large-scale
  measures are planned to save resources,"" he said.
      Finance Minister Boris Gustev told the Supreme Soviet
  defence spending in 1988 would total 20.2 billion roubles, the
  same as announced last year.
      Talyzin said the Kremlin also had decided to increase
  spending next year on medical services, education, pensions and
  social insurance schemes
      He said state expenditures in these fields would reach 171
  billion roubles in 1988, or 3.5 billion roubles more than had

  Corp &lt;GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms
  to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants.
      Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc &lt;ASH>, the
  Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for
  money-making petrochemical businesses to buy.
      ""I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period,"" said
  Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW>, adding,
  ""There's no major plant capacity being added around the world
  now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving
  the old ones.""
      Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers,
  automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of
  paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.
      U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about
  90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike
  product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,
  managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand
  for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up
  by as much as 300 pct, he said.
      Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in
  Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned
  last year and predicted it would have the best year in its
  history.
      In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel
  and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.
  dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. ""I believe the entire
  chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,""
  Oreffice said.
      GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical
  industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.
  Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion
  dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.
      The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical
  industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and
  planning, said Pace's John Dosher.
      Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocks
  dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar
  was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost
  U.S. chemical exports.
      Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has
  been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical
  manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers
  in the early 1980s.
      Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers
  have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program
  to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate
  unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of
  friendly and hostile takeover attempts.
      GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire
  Union Carbide Corp &lt;UK>, recently offered three billion dlrs
  for Borg Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics
  and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace &lt;GRA> 
  has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer
  businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.
      But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be
  headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on
  the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as
  ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that
  are custom-designed for a small group of buyers.
      ""Companies like DuPont &lt;DD> and Monsanto Co &lt;MTC> spent the
  past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity
  chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had
  deteriorated,"" Dosher said. ""But I think they will eventually
  kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche
  market."" Some top chemical executives share the concern.
      ""The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting
  carried away and repeating past mistakes,"" GAF's Heyman
  cautioned. ""The shift from commodity chemicals may be
  ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long.""
      Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the
  Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700
  mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.
      Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout
  of Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1
  billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants
  along the Texas Gulf Coast.
      The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that
  are the building blocks of specialty products.
      ""This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a
  glamorous, high-margin business,"" Cain said, adding that demand
  is expected to grow by about three pct annually.
      Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said
  chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for
  plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood
  and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical
  business could last as long as four or five years, provided the
  U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.

  National Westminster Bank USA said
  higher loans and core deposit volumes as well as a substantial
  increase in net interest income contributed to a 16 pct rise in
  first-quarter earnings to 17.7 mln dlrs from 15.3 mln reported
  a year earlier.
      The earnings gain came despite a 1.5 mln dlr reduction of
  income as a result of placing Brazilian loans on non-accrual.
      Net interest income totalled 92.5 mln dlrs compared with
  91.7 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period as loans, mostly to
  middle market businesses, increased by 896 mln dlrs. But some
  of these gains were offset by low levels of interest rates.
      Provision for loan losses rose to 13.8 mln dlrs from 13.0
  mln a year earlier. At March 31, the allowance for loan losses
  was 114.2 mln dlrs versus 94.8 mln at end of March 1986.
      Non-accrual loans rose to 286 mln dlrs from 132 mln at the
  end of the first quarter of 1986, largely because 119 mln dlrs
  of loans to Brazil were put on non-accrual status.
      The bank said that if these loans remain on non-accrual for
  the remainder of the year net income for 1987 would be reduced
  by about 4.9 mln dlrs.
      National Westminster Bank USA is a wholly-owned subsidiary

  Chemical New York Corp said its

  1.04 billion dlrs of loans to Brazil on non-accrual.
      Chemical reported first-quarter net income of 86.2 mln
  dlrs, down from 102.6 mln a year earlier, but declaring the
  Brazilian loans non-performing cost Chemical 21 mln dlrs in
  lost interest income, or 12 mln dlrs after-tax.
      A 13.3 pct jump in non-interest expense to 471.3 mln dlrs
  from 415.9 mln also hit the bottom line. It said the rise was
  mainly due to staff costs associated with continued growth in
  consumer, capital markets and investment banking activities.
      Excluding the effect of placing Brazil on non-accrual,
  Chemical said its net income would have been 98.2 mln dlrs, or
  4.3 pct below 1986 earnings.
      Brazil suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of
  medium- and long-term debt on February 20. If they are not

  whole of 1987 will be reduced by about 51 mln dlrs.
      Chemical also placed 52 mln dlrs of loans to Ecuador on
  non-accrual because the Quito government also suspended
  interest payments on its foreign debt. This reduced interest
  income by 1.5 mln dlrs.
      Chemical said net interest income fell to 476.4 mln dlrs
  from 488.9 mln and its net spread narrowed to 3.61 pct from
  3.96 pct.
      This reflected the reclassification of Brazilian loans, a
  reduced federal income tax rate (which affected the calculation
  of the taxabale-equivalent adjustment on tax-exempt assets) and
  a narrowing of the spread between the prime rate and Chemical's
  cost of funds.
      Foreign exchange trading profits rose to 37.9 mln dlrs from

['acq'],"SAN FRANCISCO, NOT REGION, HURT BY RESTRUCTURING
  Corporate mergers and acquisitions
  in and around San Francisco over the past seven years have had
  only a modest effect on the metropolitan area's economy, a
  leading business-backed organization said.
      The Bay Area Council, a group of more than 300 business
  firms, said that a study of corporate restructuring in a
  nine-county area found that San Francisco itself had suffered
  some ill effects from corporate shake-ups but that surrounding
  communities had not.
      Seventeen of the 32 Fortune 500 companies in the area left
  due to corporate restructuring between 1979 and 1986, but
  another 21 firms were added to the list.
      Ten of the departing companies were based in San Francisco.
  During the period, only six located in the city achieved
  Fortune 500 status.
      Ted Hall, a council director and local managing director of
  McKinsey and Co. which conducted the survey, said the study
  grew out of concern that mergers and acquisitions had seriously
  hurt the economic climate of northern California.
      However, Hall said that only about 36,000 jobs had been
  lost in the region, while more than 600,000 new jobs were
  created during the period.
      At the same time, he said, the region experienced a greater
  rise in per capita income and lower unemployment than the rest
  of the United States and California.
      Council President George Keller, who also is chairman and
  chief executive officer of Chevron Corp., told a news
  conference that the region had difficulties in persuading
  companies to locate there because of a fragmented local
  political system.
      But he said that because of the amenities of living in San
  Francisco, he was the envy of many chief executives in other
  metropolitan area.
      ""It's a great place to run a business,"" he added, ""but it's
  a hell of a place to do business with government.""
      The study concluded that Chevron, which mergered with Gulf
  Oil in 1984, would benefit in the long run from the
  restructuring activity.
      Among the corporate headquarters lost during the period
  were Crown Zellerbach, Memorex, Southern Pacific, Castle &amp;
  Cooke and Rolm.
      Companies that grew enough during the period to make the
  Fortune 500 list included Apple Computer, Pacific Telesis,
  McKesson, Tandem Computer, U.S. Leasing and Amfac.
      The study by the management consulting firm said that,
  partly due to corporate restructuring, the rate of job growth
  in San Francisco has slowed since 1980.
      In addition, it said that the loss of corporate leadership
  had adversely affected some of the Bay Area's civic and
  charitable activities.

['earn'],"HEINEKEN SEES HIGHER PROFITS, WIDER PENETRATION
  Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hoped
  to maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth to
  the 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despite
  continuing investments in a reorganization program and efforts
  to extend world penetration.
      Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln
  guilders, after 265 mln in 1985.
      Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe's
  leading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986,
  said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters.
      The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S.,
  Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe,
  where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total.
      Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker
  foreign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders.
      Further consolidation of foreign companies, including the
  increase of its stake in leading Spanish brewery &lt;El Aguila
  S.A.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularly
  in French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. The
  company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in
  restructuring and marketing, Heineken said.
      Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profit
  next year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had
  already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.
      Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the
  European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer
  into the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beer
  market -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. ""We
  have the beer, but distribution and sales is the important
  point,"" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken
  had been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.
      ""The question is not if we want to penetrate the German
  market, but how we are to do it,"" van Schaik said, adding that
  while the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a
  taste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very
  regionalized.
       Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for
  African operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most
  important beer growth markets in the long term.
       He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with
  majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was
  hampered by the lack of hard currencies there.
      Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters
  per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions
  and currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total
  1986 sales.
      On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price
  of imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists
  have been looking at other possibilities.
      To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on
  the Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which
  had sold successfully, Coebergh said.
      Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw
  materials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were
  popular in Rwanda . ""This is a possibility, but we could not
  possibly achieve the Heineken flavor,"" Coebergh said.
      Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts to
  penetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a
  contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.
      But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken's
  market potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow that
  are enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western
  money.

      There has been speculation in trade circles that USDA would

      Lyng indicated the two countries have been unable to agree

  South Korea's trade surplus is growing too
  fast and the government has started taking steps to slow it
  down, Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahn-je said.
      He told a press conference the government planned to
  increase investment, speed up the opening of the local market
  to foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to hold
  the surplus ""at a proper level.""
      But he said the government would not allow the won to
  appreciate too much in a short period of time. South Korea has
  been under pressure from Washington to revalue the won.
      The U.S. Wants South Korea to cut its trade surplus with
  the U.S., Which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3
  billion dlrs in 1985.
      Kim, who is also economic planning minister, said prospects
  were bright for the South Korean economy, but the government
  would try to hold the current account surplus to around five
  billion dlrs a year for the next five years.
      ""Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth, five
  billion dlrs of (current account) surplus and 12 pct growth in
  exports all seemed to be reasonable early this year. But now
  the surplus is growing faster than we expected,"" he said.
      Trade ministry officials said South Korea's exports rose 35
  pct to 9.34 billion dlrs in the first three months of this
  year, while imports rose only 8.5 pct to 8.2 billion dlrs.
      Kim said the swing of South Korea's current account to a
  surplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlr
  deficit in 1985 was very significant. The surplus enabled the
  country to reduce its foreign debt last year for the first
  time.
      South Korea's foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrs
  in 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is still among the largest
  in Asia.
      ""This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of the
  major constraints on our development... Last year was a major
  turning point for the Korean economy,"" Kim said.
      Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio of
  foreign debt to the country's GNP to about 20 pct in 1991, from
  about 50 pct in 1986.
      ""The government, however, does not want to accelerate
  reducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus,"" he
  said.
      Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflation
  and lead to trade friction with Seoul's major trading partners,
  particularly the United States.
      ""We need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt, but
  we are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at a
  proper level,"" Kim said.

  Venezuela's central bank has ordered
  Venezuelan banks and exchange houses to cease foreign exchange
  operations with brokers based outside the country, according to
  a copy of a central bank telex made available to Reuters.
      The measure, confirmed by a brokerage firm here, has
  effectively cut off all foreign participation in Venezuela's
  volatile currency market.
      The telex, issued on May 19, was signed by Carlos Hernandez
  Delfino, manager of the bank's department of international
  operations.
      The telex said the restriction on business with foreign
  brokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting foreign
  exchange houses from selling dollars or other foreign
  currencies to anyone living outside Venezuela.
      In recent weeks the Venezuelan government has denied
  rumours that it intends to impose foreign exchange controls to
  prop up the weakening bolivar.
      But brokers said the central bank's move is seen as a de
  facto currency control. ""It is definitely a control in the sense
  that there's no longer complete freedom to operate,"" one broker
  here said.
      ""Gradually they're imposing restrictions and the direction
  is towards complete control,"" the broker said.
      The broker, who requested anonymity, said virtually all his
  Venezuelan customers had stopped doing business with him since
  the central bank issued the telex and followed it up with
  telephone calls.
      He said that before the restriction was imposed the volume
  of his firm's transactions with Venezuela was about 10 mln dlrs
  a day. ""It was a frenetic market, it was really quite active,"" he
  said.
      The broker said he saw no logical explanation for the
  prohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediary
  between Venezuelan brokers, exchange houses and banks.
      ""We weren't buying dollars from Venezuelans, that's
  ridiculous,"" he said. ""They've been on a rampage against
  foreigners.""
      The broker noted that two months ago Venezuela's central
  bank quietly announced that banks doing foreign exchange
  business outside Venezuela would have to respect a new 200 pct
  reserve requirement.
      In February, the central bank also prohibited trading in
  bolivar futures, the broker said.
      ""We used to have a forward market,"" he said. ""For a small
  currency it was miraculous.""
      He said the bolivar, which averaged 20.29 to the U.S.
  Dollar in 1986, would continue to slip from its current range

"['interest', 'money-fx']","GERMAN FINANCIAL POLICY MAKERS IN RARE DISSENSION
  Karl Otto Poehl, head of West Germany's
  central bank, and Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg are
  normally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the
  central bank's independence.
      But a rare public row between the ebullient Poehl,
  president of the Bundesbank, and Stoltenberg, over a
  controversial investment tax proposal, has added to the woes of
  the country's already nervous financial markets, bankers said.
      Poehl told an investment symposium in Frankfurt last
  Thursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and
  interest rates
      Stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting Poehl's
  criticism, saying West Germany would remain an attractive place
  for foreign investors.
      ""The obvious lack of coordination between the Bundesbank and
  Finance Ministry does not instil confidence in foreign
  investors,"" said one economist for a London broker, who asked
  not to be identified.
      Bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial
  policy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship to
  steer the economy through a particularly difficult time.
      ""There are plenty of objective pressures which will result
  in things getting back to normal again after a period of ill
  feeling,"" said Commerzbank AG chief economist Juergen Pfister.
      News on October 9 that the government was planning a 10 pct
  withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in
  a market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and
  abroad.
      Bankers said the Bundesbank was angered by the way the
  finance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting the
  Bundesbank adequately, and allowing apparently conflicting
  details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market.
      Both Poehl, 57, and Stoltenberg, 59, have been under
  extraordinary pressures lately.
      Poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his
  deputy, Helmut Schlesinger, jacking up interest rates to fight
  inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had
  pursued so far this year to promote currency stability.
      In recent statements Poehl has sounded more like
  Schlesinger. For years the softly-spoken economist has been
  warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply
  growth would eventually lead to rising prices.
      Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbank
  council, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent his
  views, bankers said.
      ""Poehl is in a minority in his own house,"" said Commerzbank's
  Pfister.
      ""Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is not
  entirely his own,"" said another economist.
      The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far,
  they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the mark
  and hurting West German exporters.
      The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the
  Bundesbank's new tack became clear in early October.
      Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary James
  Baker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases.
      Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986
  war of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S.
  Officials talked down the dollar to force West Germany to
  stimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports.
      One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a round
  of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.
      But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for
  Stoltenberg than he had bargained for.
      The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly voted
  most popular government politician last year, had to face
  resistance from local barons in the government coalition
  parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.
      The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising
  4.3 billion marks.
      But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it will
  push up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs the
  government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.
      Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row
  which has turned into the country's worst political scandal.
      Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington last
  month early to sort out a row in the northern state of
  Schleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party.
      The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign after
  allegations of a ""dirty tricks"" election campaign led to heavy
  losses for the CDU in state elections.
      Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva last
  weekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide.
      Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the more
  remarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, and
  was appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
      When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier this
  year, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition government
  gave Poehl another eight-year term.
      Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said he
  hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.
      But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he was
  not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the
  Bundesbank's independence of government, Chrobok said.

"['interest', 'money-fx']","U.S. BANKS LIKELY TO LIFT PRIME RATES AGAIN SOON
  Major U.S. banks may lift prime
  lending rates again within days due to recent increases in
  their borrowing costs and speculation the Federal Reserve is
  nudging up interest rates to help the dollar, economists said.
      In what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984, most
  banks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to
  7-3/4 pct, citing a reduced gap between the prime and their own
  cost of money. That spread has narrowed again.
      ""A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,""
  said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc.
      Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct is
  justified because the spread between banks' cost of funds and
  the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a
  percentage point.
      He said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentage
  points since last October until it fell below one point and
  triggered the April prime rate rise at most banks.
      ""We could easily have another prime rate increase as soon
  as this week,"" said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co.
      ""We've got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the
  near future,"" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.
      ""Based on the spread between the prime rate and funding
  costs, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,""
  said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank.
      However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime
  because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan
  demand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintain
  recent upward pressure on money market interest rates.
      Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures lift
  short-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. He
  said ""if there is widespread belief money market rates will
  stay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time.""
      Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a
  dollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollar
  fell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traders
  said the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar.
      In addition to buying dollars outright, another way to
  stabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S.
  interest rates higher relative to overseas rates.
      Based particularly on the Fed's reserve management actions
  on Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said ""it has become
  clear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure
  in the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed.""
      Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interest
  rates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculation
  that the Fed is gently firming monetary policy.
      That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in the
  market than most economists had expected.
      On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in small
  amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements
  with the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another
  high at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pct
  today, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlr
  round of customer repurchase agreements.
      ""The Fed's actions on Friday and today show that it is
  offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,""
  said Jones of Lanston.
      ""The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the
  need to defend the dollar,"" Jones said. He believes it is
  merely shading policy toward restraint now, ""but to have a
  major impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policy
  overtly at some point.""
      Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates by
  becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, within
  four to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct.
      Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct might
  well be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts to
  further aid the dollar.
      Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on
  30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime rate
  may be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year's end.
      ""The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tightening
  policy to defend the dollar,"" said Leslie of Discount Corp. He
  said tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately.
  Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressures
  abate will show whether or not it is firming policy.

"['interest', 'money-fx']","U.S. MARKETS OFFER GLIMPSE OF VOLCKER NIGHTMARE
  Today's turmoil in the U.S. Financial
  markets, with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar's
  wake, is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology that
  is likely to spell more turbulence ahead, economists said.
      For two years, the markets had hailed the dollar's decline
  as the cure-all for the U.S. Trade deficit. Interest rates fell
  sharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up.
      But that confidence is now cracking as the financial
  markets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker's
  often-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse.
      ""Volcker's been saying for a long time that a dollar
  freefall would be extremely dangerous - now he's got it,"" said
  David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.
      The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in
  40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington
  failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a
  credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, short
  of further depreciation of the dollar.
      Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid
  worries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation, scare
  away foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit.
      The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12
  dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spike
  in interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down
  by 33 points to 2339.
      Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called the
  markets' instability frightening. He believes economic
  fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that ""once
  you start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop.""
      ""There's a stark possibility that you could get a
  destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates
  and drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic.""
      Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics
  in Washington, has been warning for a long time that the
  controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and
  264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare.
      ""We're still more or less on track for a hard landing... But
  the agony may be fairly drawn out,"" Marris told Reuters.
      Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this
  year, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it
  would take very little to touch off what he calls the second
  phase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in the
  dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.
      The stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop on
  March 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.
      The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with
  historical experience, which teaches that domestic markets are
  not affected until a currency is in the final stages of its
  decline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen.
      Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar's latest
  weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks
  suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling
  below 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set as
  part of the G-7 Paris agreement in February.
      Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss of
  confidence was triggered last week when Washington announced
  plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronic
  imports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war.
      Many economists believe that long-run stability will not
  return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is
  addressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in the
  massive budget deficit.
      But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and of
  central bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have no
  choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.
      ""The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a
  substantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding
  cut abroad, at least by Japan,"" said Lanston's Jones.
      Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest
  rates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for
  American farmers, Latin American governments and others.
      But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs and
  Co, scoffed at the notion. ""It's ridiculous to think the Federal
  Reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak
  against just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollar
  weakness,"" he said.
      Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being
  made toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit.
      ""We're going to have one of the biggest reductions in the
  budget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobody
  cares,"" he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69
  will have been greater.
      He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and

['crude'],"FAR EAST TRADERS EXPECT 20 DLR OIL IN JANUARY
  OPEC's agreement to limit output to 16.6
  mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boost
  spot prices and enable the group to raise its official
  reference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current
  18 dlrs, Far East oil industry sources said.
      ""Fundamentally, the market situation is bullish and the
  official price will be 20 dlrs in January,"" a Japanese refiner
  said.
      The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPEC
  members such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and
  Qatar, demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter.
      Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late U.S. Trading as
  the market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987
  output. In early Tokyo trade, levels were firm at 17.30 dlrs
  for Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 19.00 dlrs for
  U.K. Brent, traders said.
      They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into
  the U.S. Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate
  (WTI) trades at around 20.30 dlrs.
      ""With WTI at 20, 21 or 22 dlrs, U.S. Refiners will import
  Mideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen those
  grades further,"" said a Japanese oil trader.
      Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spot
  market has further upward potential in the short term, having
  risen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday.
      ""You could certainly argue that if New York rose on that
  basis, there's no reason for prices to go up again today,"" said
  one international oil trader in Tokyo.
      ""But I think if there's any sign of a dip, it will be bought
  back up again pretty quickly,"" he added.
      One oil industry analyst concurred, ""There is no reason to
  expect a weak market from now on."" He said he expected OPEC to
  raise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9.
      Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly
  in the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members and
  the likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer to
  maintain steady prices.
      Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day
  compared to its second-half quota of 1.54 mln, they said. Its
  export capability will rise to 2.5 mln bpd when a new pipeline
  through Turkey, comes onstream in or around September.
      Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350,000 bpd,
  against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299,000, by discounting up
  to 20 cents a barrel from official prices, the sources said.
      Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheating
  on the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective price
  discounts through counter-purchases, industry sources said. But
  they mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act as
  swing producer, cutting production to compensate for higher
  output by other members or boosting output if spot prices rise
  too high too fast.
      Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mln
  barrels. ""Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so the
  stockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it rises
  too much,"" an oil industry analyst said.

  The Justice Department said it asked
  the government to proceed cautiously on a plan allowing the

      Justice's opposition to quick federal approval of a bid by
  Greyhound Lines Inc to take immediate control Trailways Corp
  prompted Greyhound to threaten -- in a brief filed with the
  Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) -- to drop the merger
  plan.
      Greyhound officials told Reuters late today the company

      ""Greyhound Lines will go forward with the transaction only
  if it is permitted to assume immediate, unconditional control
  of Trailways' operations and to integrate them with its
  operations,"" Greyhound said in a filing with the ICC, the
  federal regulatory agency which has the final say over mergers
  of interstate bus companies.
      But Justice had said in an earlier filing with the ICC that
  it wanted the agency to move slowly on the plan and to turn
  down Greyhound's request to begin operating Trailways
  immediately.
      ""The department has just begun to receive relevant
  information on Trailways' financial condition and is in the
  process of assessing the correctness of the company's
  allegations,"" acting Assistant Attorney General Charles Rule
  said in comments submitted to the ICC.
      Greyhound announced June 19 that it wanted the ICC to let
  it begin operating Trailways immediately while continuing to
  evaluate the merger for possible antitrust problems.
      Greyhound said it would pay 80 mln dlrs for many of
  Trailways' terminals, buses and garages.
      The two companies said in papers filed with the ICC that
  Trailways ""could collapse in a matter of days.""
      They said Trailways owed suppliers more than six mln dlrs,
  with another six mln dlrs due June 30.
      The suppliers, they said, could force Trailways into
  bankruptcy ""at any time.""
      Trailways also owes a consortium of banks 76 mln dlrs, and
  the consortium has threatened to call the loan if Trailways
  fails to pay the interest due June 30, they said.

"['corn', 'grain', 'oilseed', 'soybean']","BRAZIL GRAIN HARVEST FACES STORAGE PROBLEMS
  Storage problems with Brazil's record
  grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln
  tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.
      Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia,
  told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this
  year's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.
      He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in
  harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage
  problems.
      Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes,
  theoretically sufficient for the crop.
      But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly
  distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do
  Sul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but were
  responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.
      The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West
  growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage
  capacity.
      Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and
  maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grains
  production but only 20 pct of its storage space.
      In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,
  there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to
  storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for
  storing loose grain, Brito said.
      Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the
  crops.
      The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop
  has been evident from television reports, which have shown
  enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.

['interest'],"GERMAN BANKERS' REMARKS REVIVE TALK OF RATE CUT
  Remarks by two leading central bankers
  sparked renewed speculation in financial markets that a cut in
  the West German three pct discount rate may be under
  discussion, currency dealers said.
      Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech that
  monetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflows
  required cuts in interest rates.
      Separately, West Berlin state central bank president Dieter
  Hiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall below
  its lowest ever point of 2.75 pct. He made clear that he was
  not making a forecast on interest rates, however.
      Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollar
  gained slight background support from the speculation.
      But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 3.80
  pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the money
  market this week, dashing some expectations that it may either
  offer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rate
  and let the strength of banks' demands set the allocation rate.
      It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much less
  than the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pact
  expired. This further weakened sentiment the Bundesbank could
  move to a more accommodative monetary stance, dealers said.
      Koehler said in a speech in Surrey, England, speculative
  capital inflows may cause monetary growth, regardless of
  whether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell.
      ""In other words, the monetary policy measures required are
  different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --
  those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of
  mounting economic activity.""
      Though Koehler was known to be the most liberal of the
  generally monetarist Bundesbank board, his comments marked the
  first time cuts in rates had been concretely suggested as a
  counterpoint to overly strong monetary growth, dealers said.

"['dlr', 'money-fx', 'yen']","TOKYO DEALERS SEE DOLLAR POISED TO BREACH 140 YEN
  Tokyo's foreign exchange market is watching
  nervously to see if the U.S. Dollar will drop below the
  significant 140.00 yen level, dealers said.
      ""The 140 yen level is key for the dollar because it is
  considered to be the lower end of the reference range. If the
  currency breaks through this level, it may decline sharply,""
  said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager at Dai-ichi
  Kangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division.
      The dollar was at 141.10 yen at midday against Friday
  closes of 142.35/45 in New York and 141.35 here.
      The dollar opened at 140.95 yen and fell to a low of
  140.40. It was 1.7733/38 marks against 1.7975/85 in New York
  and 1.8008/13 here on Friday, after an opening 1.7700/10.
      The currency's decline was due to remarks on Sunday by U.S.
  Treasury Secretary James Baker, dealers said.
      ""The dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearish
  sentiment after Baker's comments,"" said Dai-ichi's Tanaka. He
  said this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation among
  the group of seven (G-7) industrial nations to implement the
  Louvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying.
      The dollar's fall was also prompted by a record one-day
  drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday and weakness
  in U.S. Bond prices, dealers said.
      Baker said the Louvre accord was still operative but he
  strongly criticised West German moves to raise key interest
  rates. Operators took Baker's comment to indicate impatience
  with some G-7 members for failing to stick to the Louvre accord
  due to their fears of increasing inflation.
      Rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationary
  pressures also slow domestic demand.
      West Germany and Japan had both pledged at G-7 meetings to
  boost domestic demand to help narrow the huge U.S. Trade
  deficit, Tanaka said.
      U.S. August trade data showed the U.S. Deficit at a still
  massive 15.68 billion dlrs. But if West Germany raises interest
  rates, this would run counter to the pledge, he said.
      ""Operators are now waiting to see if the G-7 nations
  coordinate dollar buying intervention,"" said Soichi Hirabayashi,
  deputy general manager of Fuju Bank Ltd's foreign exchange
  department.
      The target range set by the Louvre accord is generally
  considered to be 140.00 to 160.00 yen, dealers said.
      ""The market is likely to try the 140 yen level in the near
  future and at that time, if operators see the G-7 nations
  failing to coordinate intervention, they would see the Louvre
  accord as abandoned and push the dollar down aggressively,""
  Hirabayashi said. He said the U.S. Currency could fall as low
  as 135 yen soon.

['iron-steel'],"TALKING POINT/STEEL COMPANIES
  Steel stocks, which have had a healthy
  runup recently, still present some short term investment
  opportunities, according to some steel analysts.
      But others say the upturn, based on strong orders and firm
  prices this spring, has been strictly seasonal and will end
  soon. They recommend taking profits.
      ""It's that time of year. This is strictly seasonal,"" said
  Charles Bradford of Merrill Lynch and Co. ""Orders will be
  strong for about two months, and there are signs that some
  (order rates) are starting to dive already.""
      But Dean Witter Reynolds Inc analyst Clarence Morrison sees
  some short-term potential in the group, which includes USX Corp
  &lt;X>, Bethlehem Steel Corp &lt;BS>, Armco Inc &lt;AS> and Inland Steel
  Industries Inc &lt;IAD>.
      ""There is still some attractiveness to steels over the
  short- to intermediate-term based on improved order rates and
  rising prices,"" Morrison said. He only recommends one stock,
  however, Inland, which is modernizing steelmaking operations to
  make them more efficient.
      Despite his bearishness, Merrill's Bradford continues to
  recommend Armco, which he sees as a major turnaround.
      Armco's steelmaking operations are profitable, the balance
  sheet has been improved, and its oilfield equipment business
  has been slimmed and put in a joint venture with USX, Bradford
  noted. ""It's not a high-quality investment situation yet but
  they've come a long way,"" he said.
      ""We think the stock will do moderately better than the
  market,"" he said. Armco shares, trading off 1/4 at 10 today,
  could go to 12, and possibly as high as 15, he said.
      Bradford sees Armco earning 50 to 75 cts a share in 1987,
  before special gains from recouped investment tax credits,
  against losses last year.
      Armco's 1988 earnings could be significantly higher, he
  said.
      Bradford is recommending sale of USX shares. ""We had a buy
  on it below 20 but when it gets to 28, let somebody else have
  it,"" he said.
      The steel and energy concern will earn about one dlr a
  share in 1987, about half of that coming from asset sales, and
  from two dlrs to 2.50 dlrs in 1988, Bradford said. ""But a lot
  depends on oil prices,"" he added. About 60 pct of USX's sales
  come from oil and natural gas.
      Other analysts, including Michelle Galanter Applebaum of
  Salomon Brothers Inc, recommend USX. ""The company's done a lot
  (of restructuring), more than the market's given them credit
  for,"" she said.
      She sees the stock going to the mid 30s or higher. USX was
  trading up 1/8 at 28-1/2. She predicts USX will earn 18 cts a
  share this year and 2.73 dlrs next year against large losses in
  1986.
      Applebaum, who is also positive on Armco and Inland, has
  been recommending the stocks since last November.
      Peter Marcus of Painewebber Inc is neutral on the group
  although he said the earnings outlook is improved through the
  third quarter.
      But he sees potential trouble beyond then. ""I think (steel)
  prices on a bookings basis will start to drop by the summer,""
  he said.
      Applebaum of Salomon Brothers also sees some seasonal
  dropoff later in the year. ""But there are more positives than
  negatives,"" she said, citing reduced capacity in the domestic
  industry, better prices, and a weaker dollar, which should
  cause steel imports to drop off slightly from last year.

"['crude', 'ship']","DIPLOMATS CALL U.S. ATTACK ON OIL RIG RESTRAINED
  A U.S. attack on an Iranian oil platform
  in the Gulf on Monday appeared to be a tit-for-tat raid
  carefully orchestrated not to be too provocative or upset Arab
  allies, Western diplomats in the region said.
      U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Monday that
  U.S. Warships destroyed the oil platform in the southern Gulf
  in response to a missile strike on the American-registered
  Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.
      ""We consider the matter closed,"" he said, a signal the U.S.
  administration did not want the Gulf crisis to escalate.
      Iran had warned the United States earlier in the day
  against exacerbating the Gulf crisis, saying military action
  would endanger American interests.
      Following the raid, a okesman for Tehran's War
  Information Headquarters vowed to avenge the attack with a
  ""crushing blow.""
      ""The United States has entered a swamp from which it can in
  no way get out safely,"" Tehran Radio quoted him as saying.
      Diplomats noted, however, Iran was also seeking to avoid
  ostracism by Arab states due to meet at a summit in Amman on
  November 8 and discuss the Iran-Iraq war.
      Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi is currently in
  Damascus, and diplomats said he would seek Syrian help in
  preventing a total Arab breach with Tehran.
      Further escalation of the war threatening the Gulf Arab
  states could work against Tehran at the Amman gathering, they
  said.
      ""The ball is in Iran's court now. It's up to Tehran to
  respond one way or the other,"" a diplomat said.
      President Ronald Reagan warned Iran of stronger American
  countermeasures if the military escalation continued.
      Western diplomats and military sources in the area said
  shelling the platform appeared to be the least provocative act
  the United States could have taken once it had decided to
  retaliate for the tanker attack, blamed by both the Americans
  and Kuwaitis on Iran.
      ""It's interesting that they chose something in international
  waters because it doesn't implicate any other nation,"" one
  diplomat said. ""This was better for U.S. Relations with the Gulf
  Arab states, particularly Kuwait.""
      Commented another diplomat: ""Kuwait must be happy that the
  U.S. Has done something, but relieved that Faw was not attacked
  on its doorstep.""
      One source said of the attack on the oil platform: ""They
  managed to warn off the crew and hit something that was the
  least nuisance to everybody.""
      A diplomat commented: ""They were very clever in the place
  they chose. It gets attention, but it hasn't devastated
  anything because it wasn't working in the first place.""
      A senior Arab banker in the area said after the news broke:
  ""This was a good, measured response without risking a flare-up
  ... It is a face-saving response (for the Americans).""

"['interest', 'money-fx']","ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - AUSTRALIAN MARKETS BOOMING
  Australian markets are booming as foreign
  fund managers redirect capital away from the United States and
  other traditional markets, analysts said.
      High short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market and
  an increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of
  fresh funds in the last two months, largely from Japanese and
  U.S. Investors, analysts polled by Reuters said.
      Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in
  and have settled on Australia, Britain and Canada as they
  diversify from volatile U.S. Dollar instruments, they said.
      A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in
  the past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for the
  currency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow.
      Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital
  are not available, but brokers said they received almost daily
  inquiries from Japan and the United States.
      ""These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about
  and they don't know what to do with it. Some of that is ending
  up here with the attraction of high interest rates and
  reasonable currency stability,"" National Australia Bank Ltd
  economist Brian Hamley said.
      ""There is a 'flight to quality',"" Hamley said. ""Australia may
  not be in the best (economic) position, but there aren't too
  many other countries where you'd want to put your money.""
      The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting
  investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against
  the volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said.
      ""We're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S.
  Where some people would be concerned about the value of the
  U.S. Dollar,"" Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose
  said. ""Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap
  and the currency looks stable?""
      But turning that capital into more permanent productive
  investment depends on government economic policy, he said.
      ""It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the
  direction in the economy,"" Buttrose said, adding that offshore
  investors would carefully watch the government's promised tough
  economic statement on May 14.
      While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding
  interest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as
  easily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who were
  badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar
  and hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said.
      ""It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to be
  delivered, if the statement wasn't considered tough enough, one
  might see a substantial outflow,"" Buttrose said.
      Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough
  economic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and
  stubborn current account deficit, analysts said.
      ""They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think
  they would like to leave the money here,"" Buttrose said.
      Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased
  interest in investment in Australia and the need to shield
  Japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.
      Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an
  element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency
  policy when he said authorities could not take their ""eyes off
  the yen"" because of the crucial role of Japanese investors.
      Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked
  successfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar
  within the range of 100 to 103 yen.
      Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, the
  Australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a
  trade-weighted basis in the last three weeks.
      Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming
  Australian share market. It has followed Wall Street and other
  markets, but is also setting its own trend in response to the
  weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into
  equities, particularly in the gold sector.
      The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3
  today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, while
  the gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in the
  same period.
      The property sector is also sought after, with Japanese
  companies that have invested heavily in the United States in
  recent years turning their attention to undervalued real
  estate, particularly in the tourism field.
      Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney's five-star
  Regent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs
  as indicative of the type of property being sought.
      ""They think they find good value real estate here which,
  with long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind of
  investment Australia needs,"" Buttrose added.

  Publisher Robert Maxwell's British
  Printing and Communicaton Corp PLC said it filed a lawsuit in
  U.S. district court against Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc, its
  directors and advisers to stop, among other things, payment of
  the special dividend Harcourt is paying as part of its
  recapitalization.
      The suit, filed in Manhattan, also names First Boston Corp
  &lt;FBC> and seeks to void the issue by Harcourt of 40,000 shares
  of super voting preferred stock to First Boston Securities Corp
  and the issue of convertible voting preferred stock with
  4,700,000 votes in the Harcourt employee stock ownership plan.
      The preferred shares to be issued to First Boston have
  8,160,000 votes. The suit, brought derivatively on behalf of
  Harcourt and individually in British Printing's capacity as a
  substantial holder of Harcourt common shares and 6-3/8 pct
  convertible debentures.
      The suit alleges Harcourt's special dividend exceeds by
  more than one billion dlrs Harcout's surplus available for
  dividends under New York law and contstitutes a fraudulent
  conveyance.
      The lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt failed to disclose
  that one consequence of the payment of the dividend, which it
  terms illegal, will be that shareholders will be liable to
  repay it.
      Harcourt last week said it would pay 40 dlrs per share to
  stockholders as a special dividend. Harcourt also announced an
  extensive recapitalization plan, which analysts said was aimed
  at thwarting a takeover effort by British Printing.
      British Printing last week withdrew its 44 dlr per share,
  or two billion dlr offer for Harcourt because of the
  recapitalizaton plan. At the time, it said it was reviewing its
  alternatives.
      British Printing said it filed the suit after consultation
  with its advisers. Its lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt
  failed to disclose the effect of the special dividend on
  Harcourt 6-3/8 pct convertible debentures.
      British Printing alleges the effect will be an enormous
  increase effective on the June eight record date for the
  dividend in the number of Harcourt common shares issuable upon
  conversion of the debentures. British Printing also charged 
  Harcourt is unlawfully coercing debenture holders to convert
  denbentures before the record date because Harcourt may not
  have enough authorized common shares to honor conversion after
  the date.
      British Printing holds 460,600 shares and 5.6 mln dlrs
  worth of debentures.
      The suit also alleges that management, the board of
  directors, and First Boston engaged in an illegal scheme of
  entrenchment through a combination of selling to First Boston
  Securities Corp the super voting preferred at a bargain price,
  the grant to the company employee stock plan of convertible
  voting preferred, the six mln share open market repurchase
  program and the manner in which its financing has been
  structured.

['cocoa'],"ASIAN COCOA PRODUCERS EXPAND DESPITE CRITICS
  Asian cocoa producers are expanding
  output despite depressed world prices and they dismiss
  suggestions in the London market that their cocoa is inferior.
      ""Leading cocoa producers are trying to protect their market
  from our product,"" said a spokesman for Indonesia's directorate
  general of plantations. ""We're happy about our long-term future.""
      Malaysian growers said they would try to expand sales in
  Asia and the United States if Malaysian cocoa was not suitable
  for European tastes.
      They were responding to comments by London traders that
  large tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from Malaysia, Indonesia
  and Papua New Guinea (PNG) were helping to depress cocoa
  prices.
      London traders said the Asian cocoa was considered
  unsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and a
  high level of free fatty acids.
      Ng Siew Kee, the chairman of Malaysia's Cocoa Growers'
  Council, said Malaysia should expand its sales to Asia and the
  United States if it did not produce a type suitable for Western
  Europe.
      A spokesman for the PNG Cocoa Industry Board said the
  London market was mistaken if it linked PNG cocoa with
  high-acid Malaysian and Indonesian beans.
      ""When the market is declining, buyers seize on anything to
  talk down prices,"" the spokesman said.
      He said that PNG could sell whatever cocoa it produces.
      PNG exported 33,000 tonnes of cocoa in the 1986/87 cocoa
  year ending September 30, of which nearly 50 pct was exported
  to West Germany, 16 pct to the U.S. And the rest to the
  Netherlands and Britain.
      The Indonesia spokesman, an Agriculture Ministry official
  who wished not to be identified, said Indonesia had no problem
  with quality and would continue to expand sales. He described
  criticism of the quality of Indonesian beans as ""trade politics""
  and said Jakarta's traditional links with Dutch buyers meant it
  did not have any difficulty with exports.
      Indonesia and Malaysia, Asia's two biggest commodity
  producers, are expanding cocoa output and are both outside the
  International Cocoa Organization (ICCO).
      Officials have said Malaysian production is expected to
  total 150,000 to 155,000 tonnes in calendar 1987.
      This is up from 131,000 tonnes in 1986, partly because of
  the end of a three-year drought in Sabah, the country's largest
  cocoa growing area.
      Production of Indonesian cocoa beans tripled to 31,600
  tonnes in calendar 1986 from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. Output is
  projected to rise to 50,000 tonnes in 1988 from 38,000 tonnes
  this year as young trees mature.
      Both Malaysia and Indonesia are low cost producers and
  traders said they could last out low prices longer than West
  African countries.
      According to one Kuala Lumpur trader, world prices would
  have to fall another 1,000 ringgit per tonne (about 250 stg) to
  make cocoa production in Malaysia uneconomic.
      Some traders believe the main quality problem is with
  harvesting and fermentation techniques.
      One trader said Malaysian cocoa is virtually
  indistinguishable from West African output if treated in the
  same way but this is not possible on the larger Malaysian
  estates.

  Demand for platinum could reach 3.4 mln
  ounces by 1991, compared with an estimated offtake of 2.88 mln
  in 1986, Chris Clark, platinum marketing director for Johnson
  Matthey Plc said.
      Clark told a meeting of the Minerals Research Organisation
  in Milton Keynes he foresaw a 250,000 ounce increase in
  consumption for use in autocatalysts, currently the largest
  single application for platinum.
      Jewellery consumption is set to rise by 70,000 ounces,
  Clark predicted in his speech, the text of which was released
  in London today.
      Clark said his forecast allowed for only a modest further
  increase in investment buying and may well be cautious.
      He said South Africa was the most likely source of
  additional supplies and will need to increase output by about
  500,000 ounces to meet increased demand.
      The capital investment required to produce the additional
  output would be around one billion U.S. Dlrs and the political
  climate may make it difficult to raise the money, he said.
      The Soviet Union, whose exports have declined since the
  1970s, might increase sales to the West by about 50,000 ounces,
  Clark said.
      ""The very probability of a growth in demand set against the
  massive investment required for expansion - and that expansion
  only being viable in South Africa or Russia - leads me to
  conclude that the price of platinum will be substantially
  underpinned in the medium to long-term,"" Clark said.

  Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
  Miyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) countries reaffirmed
  their Paris accord on stabilising currencies to convince the
  market of their resolve.
      At a news conference after today's G-7 meeting, Miyazawa
  said the ministers and central bank governors did not believe a
  totally new statement was needed.
      The speculative selling did not reflect economic
  fundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only a
  reaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, he
  said.
      He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve had
  concentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially the
  mark, had remained stable.
      Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since the
  Paris accord was not worth being called fundamental.
      ""As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement), the expression
  of 'current level' is rather vague idea,"" he said.
      The yen's movement in the past several weeks is within the
  range agreed in Paris in Febraury, he said.
      It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointing
  a level, which could have an adverse impact on the market,
  Miyazawa said.
      Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in the
  statement, he said Japan was exceptional among the seven
  because the yen appreciated against the dollar while other
  major currencies largely have been stable.
      He also said Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has
  justed adoped a package to reflate the economy while other
  nations are not supposed to produce new measures in a short
  period since the Paris agreement.
      Miyazawa also said the U.S. sanctions against Japanese
  semiconductor products was not discussed through the G-7
  meeting and did not affect the currency talks.

  The Commerce Department said on that

      The department is required by law to wait 48 hours after

['bop'],"SOUTH KOREA TO CHANGE POLICIES TO AVERT TRADE WAR
  South Korea has decided on major changes
  in its trade, investment and finance policies aimed at reducing
  the growth of its balance of payments surplus and avoiding a
  trade war with the United States, Deputy Prime Minister Kim
  Mahn-je said.
      Kim told reporters the excessively fast rise in exports
  could make South Korea too reliant on exports, increase
  nflation and produce trade friction. The policy shift, which
  means abandoning Seoul's goal of rapidly reducing its foreign
  debt, was worked out at a series of ministerial meetings.
      Kim, who is also Economic Planning Minister, said the
  current account surplus, previously expected to exceed eight
  billion dlrs this year, would be held at about five billion
  dlrs by increasing imports, accelerating market liberalisation
  and rationalising exports.
      He said Seoul would try to limit its current account
  surplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next few
  years, although trade volume would continue to grow.
      ""This will gradually reduce the ratio of the surplus to GNP
  (gross national product) from the current five pct level to
  three pct by 1991,"" he added.
      Koo Bon-yong, an aide to Kim, said South Korea's foreign
  debt had been expected to fall below 40 billion dlrs by the end
  of 1987, against the initial forecast of 41.8 billion, and 44.5
  billion dlrs at end-1986.
      ""But now (with the policy changes) the debt is expected to
  remain above 40 billion dlrs, although it could still be lower
  than the originally projected 41.8 billion dlrs,"" he said.
      The policy change was announced two days before the
  scheduled arrival of U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
  for talks with Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae.
      South Korea is under U.S. Pressure to reduce its bilateral
  trade surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs last year from
  4.3 billion dlrs in 1985.
      Kim said the policy changes were also prompted by the swing
  in South Korea's current account to a surplus of 2.06 billion
  dlrs in the first quarter of 1987 from a deficit of 438 mln
  dlrs in the same 1986 period. First quarter 1987 exports rose
  36 pct to 9.4 billion dlrs.
      The government would make foreign currency loans worth 2.5
  billion dlrs to firms willing to import capital goods, raw
  materials and equipment, preferably from the U.S., He said.
      ""The foreign currency-based loans, which carry interest at
  1.5 points above LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), are
  considerable incentives given to increase imports,"" Koo said.
      Koo said the loans would be repayable in foreign currency.
  ""It means they could become interest-free loans if the Korean
  currency continues to rise in value,"" he said.
      He said the South Korean won would be revalued against the
  dollar gradually, but added ""We do not believe in rapid one-shot
  changes in the value of the won.""
      The won, fixed at 839.70 to the dollar today, has risen six
  pct against the dollar since the beginning of 1986.

  Strong growth in domestic demand was a key
  feature of the economies of southern European countries in
  1986, though the growth is seen slowing this year and next, the

      In its semi-annual report, the OECD said Portugal's total
  domestic demand growth would decline from 7.6 pct last year to
  five pct in 1987 and 3.75 pct in 1988 as slower wage growth
  restrained private consumption.
      Turkey's economy grew much faster than expected in 1986 and
  domestic demand surged 10.5 pct, but this growth was expected
  to be halved to five pct next year.
      In Spain, buoyant domestic demand, led by fixed investment,
  had been the driving force behind rapid growth in Gross
  Domestic Product. Both fixed investment and private consumption
  were expected to ease during 1988 but would still remain
  strong.
      The OECD forecast that Spanish imports would rise sharply
  next year, reflecting strong demand, entry to the European
  Community and declining competitiveness.
      In Greece, inflation was forecast to turn downwards
  following an increase early this year linked with the

  The dollar drifted down to end one
  pfennig lower after a lacklustre session, held in limits by the
  lack of concrete news from the Group of Seven meeting and
  comments on the edge of the Washington IMF/World Bank meeting.
      Dealers said the communique early in the European morning
  from the G-7 meeting contained no significant new factors and
  although the dollar dipped it generally resisted further
  attempts to push it lower through the day.
      The U.S. Currency ended at 1.8270/80 marks, below
  yesterday's last 1.8365/75.

  based on a global view, with operators paying most attention to
  comments by finance officials to see how closely they stated
  adherence to international agreements such as those set at the
  Plaza Hotel in 1985 and in Paris on February 22.
      Koch described the wording of the communique from the G-7

      Bundebank vice-president Helmut Schlesinger told Reuters in
  a telephone interview that the German central bank sees no

      Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks
  yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West
  Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which dealers
  said revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts
  may be under consideration.
      German call money was slightly softer today, at around 3.70
  pct after 3.80 yesterday.
      Some dealers said rates on new liquidity injections added
  via Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements may be cut next
  week. Hopes of a cut were dashed on Tuesday with an allocation
  at an unchanged 3.80 pct.
      But speaking of the pact tender rate next week, Schlesinger
  said, ""since the central bank council gives its opinion on this
  theme only every 14 days, this is hardly probable.""
      Euromark rates scarcely responded to the central bankers
  comments, with six months funds ending unaltered at around
  3-7/8 pct. Eurodollars for the same maturity rose a fractional
  1/16 pct from yesterday to around 6-11/16 pct.
      Sterling dipped to end at 2.952/956 marks after 2.960/965

"['grain', 'rice', 'sugar']","INDONESIA REJECTS WORLD BANK FARM REFORM IDEAS
  Indonesia rejected World Bank
  recommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, as
  the country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5
  billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.
      Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarks
  distributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations met
  at The Hague, said, ""The general argument presented by the Bank
  for this free trade, open economy view is weak.""
      The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages the
  largest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agricultural
  growth was stagnating under subsidies for rice farming.
      The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peaked
  and the subsidies are a waste of money.
      Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides
  an income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies were
  needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,
  exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as
  assisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.
      Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers
  should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the
  government would continue to maintain production targets for
  ""strategic commodities"" such as rice and sugar.
      The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia's
  drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double
  the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country
  would save money by importing the commodity.
      However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need
  to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar
  industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.
      He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the
  agricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry
  develop and because of ""over-production and price intervention
  in the developed nations.""

"['housing', 'interest']","INTEREST RATES HURT U.S. MAY HOUSING SALES
  Sales of new single-family homes
  tumbled 14.9 pct in May from April levels because of higher
  mortgage interest rates, analysts said.
      ""There should be another month or two of very weak new home
  sales but with interest rates stabilizing, sale of new homes
  should become more stable by mid-summer,"" said economist
  Lawrence Chimerine of Wharton Econometrics Inc.
      The drop in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
  616,000 units, was the largest since January 1982, the Commerce
  Department said.
      Interest rates on conventional mortgages bottomed out at
  about 9.08 pct in March and rose to about 10.7 pct in April,
  according to Stephen Roach, economist at Morgan Stanley.
      The effect was to freeze some potential new homebuyers out
  of the market, he and others said.
      ""The rates moved very suddenly and were certainly
  unexpected by homebuyers,"" said Cynthia Latta, an economist
  with Data Resources. ""They were so startled, they wanted to
  hold back and see what would happen.""
      The drop in sales of new single-family home sales was
  sharper than expected, some economists said. ""We fully expected
  a decline but the extent was more than we anticipated,"" said
  James Christian, chief economist for the U.S. League of Savings
  Institutions.
      Christian said there was a sharp rise in May in sales of
  existing homes, which are generally less expensive than new
  homes.
      Latta of Data Resources said strong sales of new
  condominiums in the Northeast and on the West Coast were
  reflected in sales of existing but not new homes.
      Christian of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions said,
  ""Underlying housing demand remains strong. I think the market
  is going to stabilize and give us a good second half.""
      Others were less optimistic, however.
      ""We clearly won't have a boom (in new home sales) but I
  don't think this is the start of a collapse in single-family
  housing,"" said Chimerine of Wharton.
      Eugene Sherman, chief economist of the Federal Home Loan
  Bank of New York, said, ""The lower sales level will be
  maintained for awhile until there is another change in rates.
  There won't be much specific improvement in coming months.""

  The acting governor of Saudi Arabia's

  retired at his own request, oil industry sources said.
      They said Ali Ibrahim Rubaishi, head of organisation
  planning in Petromin, would take over as acting governor.
      Jawa held the post since his predecessor, Abdul-Hadi Taher,
  left in a major oil industry shake up last December.
      The sources said Rubaishi had not been expected to hold the
  post permanently.
      The government removed Taher and Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki
  Yamani from their posts late last year in a move which industry
  sources said was aimed at coming to grips with a buyers' oil
  market.
      The two men had run the Saudi oil industry for more than 20
  years. Industry sources said that despite huge resources, Saudi
  Arabia had been unable to mould an oil marketing strategy tuned
  to the competitive realities of the 1980s glut.
      Hisham Nazer, who replaced Yamani, successfully led an
  OPEC-engineered return to fixed oil prices of 18 dlrs a barrel
  last December.
      Nazer is believed to be reviewing Saudi oil operations
  which could lead to a thorough overhaul in the way Saudi Arabia
  does business, the sources said.
      The sources had said possible candidates for the governor's
  job include Prince Abdul Aziz Ibn Salman Ibn Abdul Aziz, who

  Citibank A/S &lt;CCI.N>, the Norwegian

  said they expect it to show 1987 profits after two lean years.
      Citibank's Oslo treasury head Bjoern Sejerstad told
  Reuters, Citibank, one of seven foreign bank subsidiaries
  operating in Norway, lost money because of restructuring for
  investment banking away from commercial banking and an economic
  slump in Norway following last year's plunge in oil prices.
      Foreign banks have been allowed to operate susbidiaries in

      Foreign banking analysts in Oslo said access to Norway's

  later this spring, and lower primary reserve requirements would
  make profit this year.
      Citibank lost 490,000 crowns in Norway in 1985, but

  Spectra-Physics Inc said it is
  considering the possibility of recapitalizing, restructuring,
  or seeking a buyer for the company following its rejection of
  an unsolicitied 32 dlr a share bid from Ciba-Geigy Corp.
      In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
  the San Jose, Calif., gas lasers and accessories company also
  said its board Sunday agreed to a plan that gives 52 top
  executives bonuses ranging from 20 to 50 pct of their base
  salary if they stay with the company through August 29.
      In rejecting the takeover proposal by the U.S. subsidiary
  of Swiss-based Ciba-Geigy AG, the company said it was unfair.
      The Spectra-Physics board voted unanimously, with two
  Ciba-Geigy representatives not participating, to reject the
  Swiss-based chemical and pharmaceutical company's takeover bid,
  citing an opinion from its financial advsior, Morgan Stanley
  and Co Inc, that it is ""inadequate and unfair from a financial
  point of view to the holders of shares,"" the company said.
      The board also authorized a special committee and Morgan
  Stanley to ""vigorously investigate, pursue and authorize any
  alternatives which would maximize the value of shareholders'
  investment in the company,"" the company said.
      Among the alternatives the special committee will consider
  are a sale of the company to a third party for more than 32
  dlrs a share, a recapitalization or restructuring, including
  self tender offers and/or asset dispositions through the use of
  dividends, Spectra-Physics said.
      The ""retention plan"" for the 52 top officers will pay an
  average bonus percentage of 28 pct of salary, it said.
      Spectra-Physics said its board approved the plan ""in order
  to encourage key operating personnel to remain with the company
  during the period of turmoil and uncertainty engendered by the
  (Ciba-Geigy) offer.""
      Under the plan, the executives would be entitled to their
  cash bonuses if they stay with the company through August 29,
  but could receive them earlier if they are fired for reasons
  other than gross and willful misconduct, or if they leave the
  company because their salaries have been sharply cut.
      Spectra-Physics also said it filed suit against Ciba-Geigy
  yesterday in U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Del., charging
  it with making a takeover bid that was false and misleading in
  violation of securities law and with violating the intent of
  July 9, 1985 standstill agreement.
      Spectra-Physics said Ciba-Geigy indicated at the time of
  the standstill agreement that it would not make an unsolicited
  takeover proposal for the company and that the intent of the
  agreement was that Ciba-Geigy would not acquire more than 20
  pct of the company unless there was another takeover threat.
      Ciba-Geigy was 18.8 pct of Spectra-Physics and Reliance
  Group Holdings &lt;REL>, which is controlled by New York investor
  Saul Steinberg, controls 12.8 pct.
      Spectra-Physics said the agreement prevents Ciba-Geigy from
  raising its stake beyond 20 pct through Jan 1, 1992, unless
  another person get more than 10 pct of its voting power.

      He told Reuters in a telephone interview that trading in
  palm oil, sawn timber, pepper or tobacco was being considered.
      Trading in either crude palm oil (CPO) or refined palm oil
  may also be introduced. But he said the question was still
  being considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and no
  decision on when to go ahead had been made.
      The fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubber
  physicals on an open outcry system four days a week.
      ""Several factors make us move cautiously,"" Nainggolan said.
  ""We want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make a
  mistake and undermine confidence in the exchange.""
      Physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffee
  added in January 1986. Rubber contracts are traded FOB, up to
  five months forward. Robusta coffee grades four and five are
  traded for prompt delivery and up to five months forward,
  exchange officials said.
      The trade ministry and exchange board are considering the
  introduction of futures trading later for rubber, but one
  official said a feasibility study was needed first. No
  decisions are likely until after Indonesia's elections on April
  23, traders said.
      Trade Minister Saleh said on Monday that Indonesia, as the
  world's second largest producer of natural rubber, should
  expand its rubber marketing effort and he hoped development of
  the exchange would help this.
      Nainggolan said that the exchange was trying to boost
  overseas interest by building up contacts with end-users.
      He said teams had already been to South Korea and Taiwan to
  encourage direct use of the exchange, while a delegation would
  also visit Europe, Mexico and some Latin American states to
  encourage participation.
      Officials say the infant exchange has made a good start
  although trading in coffee has been disappointing.
      Transactions in rubber between the start of trading in
  April 1985 and December 1986 totalled 9,595 tonnes, worth 6.9

  A North Sea oil find announced by Chevron

  barrels, industry analysts said.
      Chevron said a sidetrack well on block 16/26 on the U.K.
  Continental shelf tested 9,000 barrels per day (bpd) of 20 API
  crude oil from the tertiary ""Alba"" sand through a three-inch
  surface choke.
      ""The estimated amount of oil at the Alba field is around 320
  mln barrels,"" Paul Spedding of stockbroker Kleinwort Grieveson
  and Co told Reuters.
      He said industry estimates put the total reserves at the
  field at over one billion barrels, but given the low gravity of
  oil, the recovery rate would be expected to be around 20-25
  pct.
      Analysts said the results were encouraging, but the
  potential difficulty of operating and recovering oil in the
  field was shown by the fact that the first well had to be
  plugged and a sidetrack drilled.
      ""The field seems to be shallow and widespread, which will
  require a multi-platform development in recovery, pushing costs
  up,"" Christopher Osborne of stockbroker Hoare Govett said.
      Most analysts said that although the low gravity of the oil
  found would require additional costs in recovery, the test well
  showed that it flows well.
      ""Although the gravity of oil at the field seems to be low,
  it seems to flow quite well and around 300 mln barrels could be
  recovered,"" Carol Bell of Phillips and Drew told Reuters.
      However, Chevron officials declined to comment on the
  analysts' reserve estimates. They said that without further
  research and drilling in the area this summer, they would not
  disclose any reserve figures.
      Analysts said that if the field were declared commercial
  and developed, there would be a ready local market for the
  heavy crude it produced.
      ""Most refineries are now upgraded to refine heavy oils and
  the price differentials between heavy and light crudes are a
  lot narrower today,"" Osborne said.

"
['money-supply'],"FED DATA PROVIDE NEW EVIDENCE OF TIGHTER POLICY
  U.S. banking data released today are
  too distorted to draw sweeping conclusions about monetary
  policy, but they do support the market's assumption that the
  Federal Reserve has started to tighten its grip on credit,
  economists said.
      ""It's clear that the Fed has firmed somewhat. Discount
  window borrowings, net free reserves, the Fed funds rate
  average and the pattern of reserve additions are all consistent
  with a modest tightening,"" said Dana Johnson of First Chicago
  Corp.
      Johnson, and several other economists, now estimate that
  the Fed funds rate should trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8 pct.
      Discount window borrowings in the week to Wednesday were
  935 mln dlrs a day, producing a daily average for the two-week
  statement period of 689 mln dlrs, the highest since the week of
  December 31, 1986, and up from 393 mln dlrs previously.
      Moreover, banks were forced to borrow a huge 5.2 billion
  dlrs from the Fed on Wednesday - the highest daily total this
  year - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances at the
  Fed that day left banks with over two billion dlrs more in
  reserves than the Fed had anticipated.
      However, economists said it is almost certain that the Fed
  is aiming for much lower discount window borrowings than
  witnessed this week. They pointed to two factors that may have
  forced banks to scramble for reserves at the end of the week.
      First, economists now expect M-1 money supply for the week
  ended April 29 to rise by a staggering 15 to 20 billion dlrs,
  partly reflecting the parking in checking accounts of the
  proceeds from stock market sales and mutual fund redemptions to
  pay annual income taxes.
      As banks' checking-account liabilities rise, so do the
  reserves that they are required to hold on deposit at the Fed.
      Required reserves did indeed rise sharply by 2.5 billion
  dlrs a day in the two weeks ended Wednesday, but economists
  said the Fed may not have believed in the magnitude of the
  projected M-1 surge until late in the week and so started to
  add reserves too late.
      Second, an apparent shortage of Treasury bills apparently
  left Wall Street dealers with too little collateral with which
  to enagage in repurchase agreements with the Fed, economists
  said. Thus, although there were 10.3 billion dlrs of repos
  outstanding on Wednesday night, the Fed may have wanted to add
  even more reserves but was prevented from doing so.
      ""It's not at all inconceivable that the Fed didn't add as
  much as they wanted to because of the shortage of collateral,""
  said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc.
      McCarthy estimated that the Fed is now targetting
  discount-window borrowings of about 400 mln dlrs a day,
  equivalent to a Fed funds rate of around 6-3/8 pct.
      After citing the reasons why the Fed probably has not
  tightened credit to the degree suggested by the data,
  economists said the fact that the Fed delayed arranging 
  overnight injections of reserves until the last day of the
  statement period was a good sign of a more restrictive policy.
      Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank had not been convinced that
  the Fed was tightening policy. But after reviewing today's
  figures, he said, ""It's fair to say that the Fed may be moving
  toward a slightly less accommodative reserve posture.""
      Leeds expects Fed funds to trade between 6-1/4 and 6-3/8
  pct and said the Fed is unlikely to raise the discount rate
  unless the dollar's fall gathers pace.
      Johnson at First Chicago agreed, citing political
  opposition in Washington to a dollar-defense package at a time
  when Congress sees further dollar depreciation as the key to
  reducing the U.S. trade surplus with Japan.

  Good rains of one to four inches in the

  the Mackay-Burdekin region of Queensland's central coast, an
  Australian Sugar Producers' Association spokesman said.
      As previously reported, the region has been undergoing a
  severe dry spell, partly relieved by scattered rainfall, since
  December, following the virtual failure of the summer wet
  season.
      Mills in the area have been reporting that their crops are
  beginning to look healthy and greener and are putting on growth
  since the rains began, the spokesman said from Brisbane.
      Although the Mackay-Burdekin crop outlook is much better
  than it was, there will be some cane losses, the spokesman
  said. But is too early to say what they will be and more rain
  is needed to restore sub-soil moisture.
      Elsewhere, in far north Queensland, the Bundaberg region
  and southern Queensland, the cane is in excellent condition and
  some mills are forecasting record crops, he said.
      Initial 1987 crop estimates will probably be compiled

  television sets and some hand tools because Japan did not honor
  an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at
  less than cost and to open its markets to U.S. products. The
  tariffs were placed on items which were available from other
  sources so there would be little effect on the American
  consumer, Fitzwater said.
      Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action
  - especially against Japan - to end global unfair trade
  practices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit.
      The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would.
      The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billion
  dlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for about
  one-third of America's overall deficit.
      But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, West
  Germany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said the
  president is ready to fight them all.
      Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that ""I regret
  that these actions are necessary,"" but that the health and
  vitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential to
  American competitiveness in world markets.
      ""We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading
  practices,"" Reagan added in the statement from his California
  vacation home at Santa Barbara.
      He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japan
  abided by the agreement.
      U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress -
  which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that he
  already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade.
      The White House aide said of the tariff action, ""it wasn't
  done to appease Congress, but because there was an unfair trade
  practice.""
      The aide added, however, ""on another plane, it was an
  example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight
  unfair practices, an that it is not necessary to make a major
  overall of our trade laws.""
      But the analyst, Crandall, said the tariff action was not
  in the best interests of the United States, and that
  negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue.
      ""It's very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route,"" he
  said, ""because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in
  trade.""
      Crandall said, ""the administration is doing this for its
  political impact across the country, and therefore its impact
  on Congress.""
      He said, ""I don't think it makes a lot of sense.""
      But other analysts said it made little difference whether
  the tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress,
  and that the main point was that the trading partners were on
  notice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use.
      Spokesman Fitzwater said ""we don't want a trade war,"" but the
  imposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when
  it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.

  National Distillers and Chemical Corp
  expects to realize a second quarter after-tax gain of four dlrs
  per share from the 545 mln dlr sale of its spirits business to
  American Brands Inc &lt;AMB>.
      National Distillers' stock rose 1-1/8 to 65-1/2, after an
  opening delay on the New York Stock exchange for an imbalance
  of orders.
      ""I think the sales price was higher than most people
  expected,"" said John Henry of E.F. Hutton Group.
      A company spokeswoman said the four dlr per share gain will
  be included in second quarter net, which compares with 31 cts
  per share last year, including the spirits and wine business
      ""They netted over 700 mln dlrs for spirits and wine. That
  will ease their interest cost burden,"" said Henry.
      National Distillers sold its wine business last month to
  Grand Metropolitan PLC's Heublein Inc for 128 mln dlrs.
      Henry said he had anticipated National Distillers would net
  only 600 mln dlrs at the most from the sale of the two liquor
  businesses.
      Henry said the company recovered from the sales the cost of
  buying Enron Chemicals in the fourth quarter last year.
  National Distillers paid 570 mln dlrs cash for Enron and
  assumed 34 mln dlrs in debt. National Distillers said at the
  time it bought Enron it would sell the spirits and wine
  businesses, moving more into the chemical area.
      For 1986, two thirds of income were from chemicals and
  propane. National Distillers earned, excluding the liquor
  businesses, 2.21 dlrs per share for 1986. Income from
  discontinued operations, including the liquor businesses, was
  67 cts per share.

  Texaco Inc &lt;TX> said its decision to
  file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
  code will not affect the majority of its businesses.
      It said its subsidiaries, which account for 96 pct of its
  32.6 billion dlrs in revenues and 79 pct of its net property,
  plant and equipment, were free of the action.
      Only parent holding company, Texaco Inc, and operating
  subsidiaries, Texaco Capital Inc and Texaco Capital N.V, are
  affected, it said.
      But the company said it was likely to suspend its 75 cents
  per share quarterly common stock dividend and halt repayments
  on debts of some 6.8 billion dlrs.
      Texaco said it filed for Chaper 11 because suppliers were
  demanding cash payments and banks were withholding loans as a
  result of a legal dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL>.
      Texaco is fighting a Texas law requiring it to post a bond
  of more than 10 billion dlrs before it can appeal a 1985
  judgment that ruled it illegally interfered with Pennzoil's
  1984 acquisition of Getty Petroleum Corp &lt;GTY>. The bond almost
  matches the damages awarded against Texaco.
      Should Texaco fail to place the bond, Pennzoil could begin
  to attach its assets to secure the judgment.
      Last Monday, the Supreme Court overturned a decision to cut
  Texaco's bond to one billion dlrs, and sent the issue back to
  the Texas courts.
      Analysts said the bankruptcy filing effectively froze all
  Texaco's obligations while it continued to appeal the merits of
  the Pennzoil lawsuit.
      ""Attempts last week to win a compromise on both the bond
  issue and the larger dispute failed,"" James Kinnear, Texaco's
  president and chief executive officer, told reporters.
      Kinnear said Pennzoil's disclosure in court papers on
  Friday that it wanted to extend the bond issue hearing until
  the end of April, pushed Texaco further towards Chapter 11.
      Pennzoil had asked Texaco to post a 5.6 billion dlr cash
  bond and to reduce its dividend to not more than 50 pct of
  earnings. Pennzoil also wanted assurances that Texaco would not
  sell any assets, Kinnear said.
      Texaco offered to put up one billion dlrs in a letter of
  credit and agreed not to let the value of its assets fall under
  11.1 billion dlrs, he added.
      Joseph Jamail, a Houston attorney for Pennzoil, said the
  company had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco on
  Saturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed for
  bankruptcy.
      He declined to reveal the amount of the proposal, citing a
  confidentiality agreement between the two companies. ""Texaco
  told us they would get back to us but instead they chose to go
  to bankruptcy court,"" Jamail said.
      Attorneys for Pennzoil said they believed the company would
  prevail in court appeals, adding that Texaco's assets were
  ample ultimately to pay the Pennzoil judgment in full.

  General Electric Corp said its
  first quarter results were significantly higher due to the

      General Electric also attibuted continued strong
  performances in plastics, major appliances and the Employers
  Reinsurance Corp for its strong quarter.
      GE recorded net earnings for the first quarter 1987 of 624
  mln dlrs, or 1.37 dls per shr, up 16 pct from 537 mln dlrs, or
  1.18 dlrs per share for the same quarter a year ago.
      General Electric chairman John Welch Jr reiterated the
  company's outlook for 1987 in which it expects double-digit GE
  earnings growth for the year. He said the first quarter results
  are in line with those expectations.
      General Electric cited the strong results in TV network and
  station operations of the National Broadcasting Co, which was
  not part of GE in the first quarter of 1986, as one reason for
  its strong earnings.
      It also noted that aircraft engine operating profit was
  much higher than a year ago, caused by a increase in shipments
  than the 1986 quarter, which was impacted by a strike.
      Aerospace revenues were sharply higher in this year's first
  quarter from a year ago, mainly because of the inclusion of
  RCA's aerospace and defense business, the company said.
      In addition, consumer products revenues were up from last
  year, mainly because of including sales of RCA video products.
      General Electric said restructuring provisions of 308 mln
  dlrs before taxes to implement various strategic moves were
  charged against operations in the first quarter of 1987. It
  added that there was a one-time gain of 281 mlns dlrs after
  taxes from an inventory accounting change.

"['interest', 'money-fx']","GERMAN MONEY MARKET SPLIT ON LOWER RATE PROSPECTS
  Remarks by central bankers raised some
  hopes the Bundesbank will cut rates on securities repurchase
  pacts, but operators remained divided on the likelihood of a
  move in the near term, money market dealers said.
      Comments by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler yesterday
  that rate cuts were needed to curb money supply growth from
  speculative capital inflows, and by West Berlin state central
  bank president Dieter Hiss that there was no natural lower
  limit to the discount rate had, however, no immediate impact.
      Call money declined to 3.65/75 pct from 3.75/85 pct but the
  drop was tied to extra liquidity in the market, dealers said.
      Dealers said the Bundesbank's latest liquidity allotment
  this week dashed some hopes of lower rates.
      The Bundesbank allotted only 6.1 billion marks yesterday in
  new liquidity in a repurchase pact at an unchanged rate of 3.80
  pct, thus subtracting some 8.8 billion marks from the market,
  as an outgoing 14.9 billion pact expired.
      But some dealers said the smaller volume awarded by the
  pact was in line with present liquid money market conditions,
  and did not exlude a cut in the repurchase pact rate soon to
  3.70 pct if money market rates continue at present levels.
      The next opportunity for the Bundesbank to lower rates on
  repurchase pacts will be in a tender expected next Tuesday.
      Bundesbank officials have already said they favour more
  discreet rate adjustments through repurchase pacts, rather than
  the more public adjustment of leading rates.
      The Bundesbank may either set a fixed allocation rate and
  allow banks to tender for the volume, as has been the case
  since it lowered its discount rate January 22, or else it may
  allow banks to tender for the rate and set the volume itself.
      Dealers expect volume of the tender to be lower than the
  15.2 billion marks flowing out, to offset other incoming funds.
      Some seven billion marks is expected to flow in next week.
  This should then flow back into the market as it is deposited
  with banks.
      Banks were well supplied with liquidity, holding 61.5
  billion marks in reserves at the Bundesbank on Tuesday.
      Holdings of average daily reserves over the first seven
  days of April stood at 59.6 billion marks, still above the
  estimated 51 billion required for all of April.

"['money-fx', 'nzdlr']","ECONOMIST URGES MORE TAXES TO LOWER N.Z. DOLLAR
  An income tax surcharge and capital
  gains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of
  the N.Z. Dollar, independent economist Len Bayliss said.
      Bayliss, a former economist with the Reserve Bank and the
  Bank of New Zealand, said a major depreciation is needed to
  restore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by
  current government policies.
      The taxes would help cut the budget deficit, which in turn
  would lower the value of the N.Z. Dollar, he said in a speech.
  He added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 could
  be much higher than the government's 1.3 billion dlr forecast.
      Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a
  percentage of gross domestic product, a major tax increase was
  probably unavoidable, Bayliss said.
      He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pct
  value-added goods and services tax, introduced in October 1986,
  but that would have had a short-term inflationary impact.
  Import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary
  impact of a currency depreciation.
      The government had failed to bring inflation down despite
  lower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency, he added.
      New Zealand's inflation rate was 16.9 pct in the year to
  end-September against 18.9 pct in the year to end June.
      The major deficiency in the government's anti-inflation
  policies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and
  insufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit, Bayliss
  said. The government had also failed to reduce overseas debt
  and debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit.
      ""The widespread belief that (New Zealand's) problems are
  going to take much longer to solve than was originally thought
  is soundly based -- primarily because the government's
  macro-economic policies have been unsuccessful,"" Bayliss said.

  Japanese oil companies are starting

      Ten companies plan to offer the unleaded gasoline this
  summer, starting with &lt;Idemitsu Kosan Co Ltd> on June 20.
      Showa Shell Sekiyu KK &lt;SHOL.T> introduced its Formula Shell
  98 octane gasoline to the Japanese market in January this year.
      Formula Shell has achieved strong sales in Japan despite a
  higher price than regular octane gasoline, which has prompted
  other oil firms to offer a rival product, the sources said.
      ""We have received a good response from consumers of Formula
  Shell in terms of a smoother ride and effective fuel
  consumption,"" Showa Shell said.
      Shell's product sells for 145 yen per litre, 15 yen higher
  than regular gasoline, and has already achieved a 38 pct share
  of Japan's high octane gasoline market, it said.
      High octane gasoline accounts for 25 pct of Shell's total
  gasoline sales in Japan, it added.
      Idemitsu said it hopes to raise high octane sales to 20 pct
  of its total gasoline sales from about seven pct, immediately
  after the launch of its Idemitsu 100.
      Nippon Oil Co Ltd &lt;NPOL.T> said it will launch its 100
  octane gasoline on July 1, aiming for an increase in high
  octane sales to 20 pct from six pct of its total gasoline
  sales.
      The rush to compete for high octane gasoline market share
  has been spurred by expectations that the government will lift
  gasoline production quotas and restrictions on gasoline station
  construction in the next two to three years.
      ""Major oil companies are trying to boost their gasoline
  sales network ahead of the proposed lifting of gasoline
  production quotas,"" an official at a major oil company said.
      An advisory panel to the Ministry of International Trade
  and Industry (MITI) recommended this week that the government
  press ahead with deregulation of the oil industry, including
  the lifting of gasoline production quotas, to help oil
  companies increase their international competitiveness.
      Japan's three biggest gasoline marketers, Nippon Oil,
  Idemitsu and Showa Shell, suffered supply shortages under the
  production quota guideline in fiscal 1986, ended last March.
      Domestic gasoline demand during the year was up 2.5 pct

  President Reagan called for continued
  nondiscriminatory treatment for Romanian exports to the United
  States in the face of congressional opposition because of the
  Bucharest government's record on human rights.
      A White House statement said Reagan's decision to press for
  continuation of so-called Most Favored Nation (MFN) status for
  Romania had been ""exceptionally difficult"" and came after ""all
  options were seriously considered.""
      But the statement said that despite concerns about human
  rights abuses by the Bucharest government, the president had
  decided that should be continued because it helped stimulate
  emigration from Romania and gave the United States influence on
  human rights practices there.
      The statement was issued as Reagan sent to Congress
  requests for one-year extensions of MFN for Romania, Hungary
  and China.
      The House of Representatives has attached to a trade bill
  legislation that would temporarily deny MFN for Romania pending
  certification by Reagan that the country had made progress on
  human rights. There is no controversy over continuation of MFN
  for Hungary and China.

  The United States responded to an
  apparent escalation of Iranian rhetoric with continued
  assurances that its expanded military force in the Gulf would
  play purely a deterrent role.
      ""I can only emphasize that our role there is deterrent, that
  we're going to be assuring safety for American shipping and
  that that shipping is not related to the war itself,"" State
  Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters.
      He was asked about Iranian claims that the United States
  was moving towards the brink of armed conflict with Iran.
      Tehran Radio quoted defence spokesman Ali Akbar Hashemi
  Rafsanjani telling a visiting Nicaraguan delegation yesterday,
  ""At the moment the United States is moving towards the brink of
  an armed encounter with us.
      ""We are not concerned about this and believe that the U.S.
  Presence in the war will make our nation even more serious. We
  are determined to stand firm and will certainly win.""
      The United States disclosed last week it was beefing up its
  Gulf fleet from seven to 10 warships and also sending the
  refurbished battleship Missouri to patrol just outside the
  strategic Strait of Hormuz, entrance to the Gulf.
      The buildup ties in with U.S. Plans to escort Kuwaiti oil
  tankers which have been re-registered to fly the American flag
  and gain naval protection against Iranian attacks.
      Asked about the Iranian rhetoric, White House spokesman
  Marlin Fitzwater said, ""We won't have any comment or response to
  the Iranian statements. Our position has been made clear about
  the status of events in the Gulf. We want an end to the war
  with no winners and no losers and any activities or statements
  that tend to prolong the war or increase hostilities are not
  helpful or welcome.""
      Redman said he could not independently confirm reports that
  Iran has offered to halt attacks on Gulf shipping.

      Yesterday's intervention was large in terms of the

"['carcass', 'livestock']","U.S. MEAT, POULTRY INSPECTION CALLED FAULTY
  The U.S. meat and poultry inspection
  programs are incapable of protecting consumers from
  contaminated products, groups representing inspectors and
  consumers charged.
      ""The whole trend of inspection for the last 10 years has
  been to corrupt and to degrade the system where today the
  public is at constant risk to contaminated and adulterated
  meat,"" Kenneth Blaylock, president of the American Federation of
  Government Employees, told a House Agriculture subcommittee.
      ""The American consumer has little reason to feel confident
  about the safety of meat and poultry being offered to him
  today,"" said Rodney Leonard, executive director of the Community
  Nutrition Institute.
      ""Company management is less concerned about the risk to
  health than about raising plant output and company profits,""
  Leonard told a hearing of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on
  Livestock, Dairy and Poultry.
      Kenneth Morrison, staff associate at the Government
  Accountability Project, said inspectors consistently disclose
  violations of federal law, demonstrating a ""serious breakdown in
  the entire inspection system.""
      Morrison told of chicken fat for flavoring being
  contaminated by ""intestines dragging in a water trough used to
  flush away the condemned product, fecal material, human spit,
  chewing gum and paper towels used by plant employees to blow
  their noses.""
      Donald Houston, administrator of the U.S. Agriculture
  Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service, FSIS, defended
  the government's program, calling it ""one of the most respected
  public health programs in the world.""
      FSIS inspects an estimated 127 mln head of cattle and 4.5
  billion chicken and turkeys every year.
      Houston said inspection programs have kept pace with
  change, but conceded that the danger of chemical residues in
  the meat and poultry supply has increased.
      He also said that, although he was confident the bacterium
  salmonella eventually could be eradicated, it would take time
  and much money to contain the growing problem.
      Salmonella, which in extreme cases can cause death, is
  found in approximately 37 pct of U.S. broilers, 12 pct of raw
  pork and three to five pct of raw beef, Houston said.
      The number of reported cases has doubled over the past 20
  years, he said, to 40,000 cases annually.
      ""We certainly really have not found an effective means of
  turning this disease around,"" said Rep. James Olin (D-Va.)
      The National Research Council recommended in 1985 that FSIS
  intensify efforts to develop rapid diagnostic procedures for
  detecting microoganisms.
      But the meat and poultry industries have said such controls
  would cost too much.
      ""Hopefully we will not overreact by installing unnecessarily
  complicated procedures that may become obstacles to the real
  goal of providing an increasingly safer, more nutritious and
  economical meat supply for consumers,"" Stanley Emerling,
  executive vice president of the National Association of Meat
  Purveyors, said.
      Blaylock, speaking on behalf of food inspectors, said a new
  program allowing elimination of USDA inspection functions at
  certain plants ""voids the law in letter and spirit, and must be
  repealed or we will see rising consumer fraud and an epidemic
  of death and illness for which there will be no prevention nor
  legal recourse.""
      Subcommittee Chairman Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) said the
  panel would hold a hearing on salmonella June 2.

  Japan's Agriculture Ministry, angered by
  U.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, will
  tell U.S. Officials at talks later this month that
  liberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan,
  a senior ministry official said.
      ""Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drives
  by other suppliers,"" the official, who declined to be named,
  said. ""Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products and
  it is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberalise
  its farm import market,"" he said.
      Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.
  Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open
  its wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated to
  protect local farmers.
      Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat
  exports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.
  End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.
      U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due to
  visit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will ask
  Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers and
  remove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.
      Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market
  share here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has
  been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year
  beef accord next March 31.
      Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales
  from China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports
  from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although
  the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.
      U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its
  beef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain
  imports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.
      An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when
  Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has
  the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.
  Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing
  some one billion dlrs in new business.
      The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs
  and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import
  controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,
  purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,
  prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.
      To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan's
  top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove
  residual import restrictions on agricultural products.
      But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional
  reaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue
  should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the
  industrial sector.
      ""Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these
  issues should not be discussed on the same table,"" the official

      By changing the definition of subsidy under U.S.
  countervailing duty law, House of Representatives Bill 3
  removes protection for companies that take advantage of widely
  used government programs, Zimmerman told a media briefing.
      ""Clearly, any industry to which Canadian governments grant
  rights to fish, mine, cut timber, or produce power could be
  vulnerable to a finding of a subsidy under this language,"" he
  said.
      The Canadian forest lobby's Zimmerman also said the House
  of Representative Bill would adopt a new way of measuring
  subsidies that would greatly increase the size of any
  countervailing duties that might be imposed on Canadian
  resource exports to the U.S.
      Under the bill, any difference between Canadian prices and
  U.S. or world market prices would constitute a subsidy, he
  said. Such a method would make Canadian resource industries
  vulnerable to similar penalties like a 15 pct export tax
  imposed last January on shipments of Canadian softwood lumber
  to the U.S., Zimmerman added.
      Canadian negotiators agreed to levy the new tax if a U.S.
  forest industry lobby would drop its request for a countervail
  duty on imports of Canadian softwood lumber.
      ""We represent the first victim of the move to price other

"['crude', 'ship']","REAGAN HINTS U.S. WANTS HELP IN PATROLLING GULF
  President Reagan said he would discuss
  the Mideast Gulf situation with allied leaders at next week's
  Venice economic summit and hinted he would seek their help in
  preserving free navigation.
      In a speech prepared for delivery as the United States made
  plans to protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers from Iranian attack,
  Reagan said the American people were aware that ""it is not our
  interests alone that are being protected.""
      Saying that allied dependence on gulf oil was no secret,
  Reagan declared, ""During the upcoming summit in Venice, we will
  be discussing the common security interests shared by the
  western democracies in the MIDEAST Gulf.
      ""The future belongs to the brave. Free men should not cower
  before such challenges, and they should not expect to stand
  alone.""
      Reagan will meet the leaders of Britain, France, West
  Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan at the economic summit, which
  will take place in Venice June 8-10.
     
      The 13th annual top-level meeting of the major industrial
  democracies will take place against a backdrop of rising
  congressional concern over Reagan's plan to protect gulf
  shipping and demands that the allies do more.
       These concerns were heightened by the May 17 Iraqi missile
  attack on the U.S. frigate Stark which killed 37 seamen.
      ""They died while guarding a chokepoint of freedom, deterring
  aggression and reaffirming America's willingness to protect its
  vital interests,"" Reagan said.
     
      In a pre-summit speech celebrating the 40th anniversary of
  the Marshall Plan, Reagan, who spoke to an audience of foreign
  affairs experts, also pledged to push for economic expansion by
  West Germany and Japan to bolster the world trading system.
      ""While the vibrancy of the U.S. economy has contributed
  enormously to the world expansion, preserving a growing world
  economy is the business of every member of the world trading
  community,"" he said.
     
      ""It will be made clear, especially to our friends in Japan
  and the Federal Republic of Germany, that growth-oriented
  domestic policies are needed to bolster the world trading
  system on which they depend.""
      Reagan coupled this appeal with a call for compliance with
  allied accords on exchange rate stability.
      ""Economic policy decisions made last year in Tokyo and at
  this year's meetings of Group of Seven finance ministers in
  Paris and in Washington cannot be ignored or forgotten,"" he
  said. ""The commitments made at these meetings need to be
  translated into action.""

['crude'],"U.S. OIL PRICES STRONG AHEAD OF OPEC MEETING
  U.S. crude oil prices are at their
  highest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPEC
  meeting, even though most industry analysts do not expect any
  policy changes from the session.
      They said prices, which have steadily climbed since the
  organization's accord in December, have risen on technical
  factors within the market and concerns about supplies because
  of the Iran-Iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from the
  Gulf.
      The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading
  around 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile
  Exchange's energy futures and in the spot market. That is its
  highest level since January 1986.
      OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria's
  oil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to
  be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production
  agreement may only need a slight review.
      Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation
  of the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due to
  a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises.
      Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon
  after the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increased
  tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, prices
  should begin easing.
      ""OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed
  to in December because oil prices are firm,"" said John Hill, a
  vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures.
      OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at
  18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to
  16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mln
  barrels in the fourth quarter.
      This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, rising
  from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December.
      Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran,
  Algeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and a
  reduction in output.
      ""And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues to
  trade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance that
  OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price,"" said Nauman
  Barakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.
      But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, such
  as Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy.
      ""The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the
  official prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, are
  committed to stabilizing the market,"" said Rosario Ilacqua,
  analyst with L.F. Rothschild.
      However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting
  in September to re-evaluate market conditions.
      Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the
  fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels a
  day and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000
  barrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, president
  of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation.
      Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this
  meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to
  offset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominated
  throughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines,
  producers receive less money for their oil.
      ""The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,""
  said Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.
      ""In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to
  produce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act
  as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two
  dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting,"" he
  said.
      One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war.
      ""The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian
  Gulf,"" said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-Bache
  Securites.
      Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been
  regular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administration
  is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the
  U.S. flag, with naval escorts.
      ""Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis
  like this, and just general nervousness over an incident that
  could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up,"" Knuettel said.
  

"
['lead'],"LEAD PRICES RISE ON FINELY BALANCED PHYSICALS
  Lead prices have risen this week against
  a background of a finely balanced physical sector, traders
  said.
      Further gains are possible if the USSR steps up its buying
  or if labour problems develop in North America, they added.
      London Metal Exchange (LME) prices are unusually buoyant at
  a time of year when seasonal demand is normally slackening and
  prices tending to drift lower.
      This buoyancy is generally attributed by traders to the low
  level of LME stocks and steady, if unspectacular, physical
  demand in the Northern Hemisphere finding supplies curtailed.
      The supply problems are not new but are beginning to be
  felt by a market in which, as peak winter demand tails off,
  stocks usually build fast and availability increases, traders
  said.
      The lower supply levels result from a number of different
  factors around the globe.
      Delayed shipments from Peru to Mediterranean countries
  because of production and transport problems, lack of Spanish
  exports since the closure last year of Cia La Cruz's smelter at
  Linares and lower output in Morocco and Greece have all meant
  additional demand being directed to merchants who in turn have
  been drawing on LME stocks.
      In addition Broken Hill Associated Smelters' Port Pirie,
  South Australia, smelter is halting production for five weeks
  for maintenance. Although the company said it would meet
  commitments, this will put further pressure on stocks.
      And the U.S. Company Doe Run has kept its 140,000 tonnes
  per year Boss, Montana smelter closed. This cut producer stocks
  and contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within the
  U.S. Market, for many years depressed by surplus production and
  a regular supplier to the world market.
      Mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled LME stocks,
  have been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said.
      On the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held up
  quite well and some U.S. Buying of lead sheet has been reported
  in the U.K. Soviet lead buying, notably absent in Europe in the
  first two months of the year, was resumed when a large buying
  order was filled by merchants in March.
      Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead prices
  this week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg and
  establish a premium of around 10 stg over three months
  delivery. Specific demand has been directed towards metal in
  Gothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is often
  a target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said.
      On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerp
  and Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each,
  and this is believed to be in strong hands.
      Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowest
  level since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouses
  which are not popular with merchants putting together
  shipments.
      But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes since
  the start of the year. Traders said this is partly due to
  secondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed supplies
  affected by environmental controls, which put restrictions on
  the transport of used batteries.
      Labour negotiations in North America will play an important
  part in determining the direction of prices, with contracts
  expiring end-April at Cominco's Trail and Kimberley, B.C.,
  Mine/smelter and at Doe Run's Herculaneum, Mo, smelter.
      Noranda's New Brunswick mine/smelter also has a contract
  expiry in July which may cause some nervousness in view of
  strikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months.
      Traders said LME three months delivery, already attracting
  speculative buying, could rise to 320/330 stg on current
  firmness, while nearby tightness could widen the cash premium
  to 20 from four. Three months was quoted at 313 stg at
  midsession.

"['corn', 'grain', 'oilseed', 'sorghum', 'soybean', 'sunseed', 'wheat']","FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED
  Argentine grain producers adjusted
  their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop
  downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the
  end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.
      They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates
  had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which
  has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.
      However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,
  producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain
  could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.
      Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27
  millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in
  Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in
  Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.
      There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.
      Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce
  rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the
  crops, including soybean.
      However, as the lands began drying later in the week
  harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40
  pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.
      Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested
  material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield
  estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.
      The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at
  2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast
  last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of
  4.1 mln.
      Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9
  to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.
      Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area
  sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will
  begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.
      Production estimates for maize were down from last week at
  9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated
  previously.
      This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln
  tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and
  21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln
  tonnes.
      Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to
  seven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.
      Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in
  Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and
  Buenos Aires in mid-April.
      The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3
  to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.
      The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln
  tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,
  and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2
  mln tonne crop.
      The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,
  remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5
  pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for
  1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of
  7.1 mln.
      The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln
  to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln
  sown in 1985/86.
      The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some
  areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some
  experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas
  making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on
  this were not available.
      Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which
  will be sown between May and August or September, has so far
  not been as intense as in previous years.

  There will be no serious bids at European

      The failure of farm ministers this week to come to an

  The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation
  (FAO) said global wheat and coarse grain output was likely to
  fall in 1987 but supplies would remain adequate to meet demand.
      FAO said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total world
  grain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1,353 mln in
  1987, due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the Soviet
  Union, drought in China and reduced plantings in North America.
      World cereal stocks at the end of 1986/87 were forecast to
  rise 47 mln tonnes to a record 452 mln tonnes, softening the
  impact of reduced production. But stocks are unevenly
  distributed, with about 50 pct held by the U.S.
      ""Thus the food security prospects in 1987/88 for many
  developing countries, particularly in Africa, depend crucially
  on the outcome of this year's harvests,"" FAO said.
      FAO said world cereal supplies in 1986/87 were estimated at
  a record 2,113 mln tonnes, about five pct higher than last
  season and due mainly to large stocks and a record 1986
  harvest, estimated at 1,865 mln tonnes.
      FAO's forecast of 1986/87 world cereals trade was revised
  upwards by eight mln tonnes to 179 mln due to the likelihood of

  U.S. warships destroyed an Iranian oil
  platform in the Gulf on Monday and the Navy also raided a

  attack on a U.S. flag tanker, the Pentagon said.
      President Reagan and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger
  warned Iran of even stronger countermeasures if the military
  escalation between the two countries continued in the volatile
  waterway.
      Reagan said he ordered the strike on the first platform by

  at the Rostam oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain in the central

      One of them, sitting astride the Rostam offshore oilfield,
  was all but blown out of the water by U.S. Warships on Monday.
      The Iranian platform, an unsightly mass of steel and
  concrete, was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60
  metres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four U.S.
  Destroyers pumped some 1,000 shells into it.
      The U.S. Defense Department said just 10 pct of one section
  of the structure remained.
      U.S. helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after an
  American helicopter came under fire earlier this month and U.S.
  forces attacked, seized, and sank an Iranian ship they said had
  been caught laying mines.
      But Iran was not deterred, according to U.S. defense
  officials, who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkworm
  missiles to hit a U.S.-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursday
  and the Sea Isle City on Friday.
      Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait, a
  key backer of Iraq in its war with Iran.
      Henry Schuler, a former U.S. diplomat in the Middle East
  now with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaiti
  tankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping.
      But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the level
  of violence and threats to shipping had increased as a result
  of U.S. intervention and Iran's response.
      The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of a
  U.S. ""tit-for-tat"" policy that gave Iran the initiative, said
  Harlan Ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS.
      He said with this appraoch America would suffer ""the death
  of one thousand cuts.""
      But for the United States to grab the initiative
  militarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran's
  harbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which its
  shipping must pass, Schuler said.
      He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringing
  Iran to the neogtiating table. If vital supplies were cut off,
  Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq.
      Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomatic
  initiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an
  arms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate.
      He said the United States should also threaten to mine and
  blockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq to
  acknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a
  settlement.
      Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war by
  invading Iran's territory in 1980. Iraq blames Iran for the
  outbreak of hostilities, which have entailed World War I-style
  infantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties.
      Each side has attacked the others' shipping.

['carcass'],"U.S. MEAT INDUSTRY LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN IN JAPAN
  The U.S. meat industry has launched an
  aggressive promotion campaign in Japan to increase consumer
  awareness of U.S. beef and persuade the Japanese government to
  relax current beef import quotas.
      U.S. beef sales to Japan, currently around 480 mln dlrs
  annually, could increase to over two billion dlrs and as high
  as six billion dlrs by the year 2000 if Japanese quotas were
  removed and the Japanese consumer were made more aware of the
  attributes of U.S. beef, officials of the U.S. Meat Export
  Federation said at a press conference today.
      Partially funded with a 6.5 mln dlr award made through the
  Agriculture Department's Targeted Export Assistance (TEA)
  program, a five-year meat promotion campaign in Japan was
  launched by the U.S. Meat Export Federation in April.
      ""The promising Japanese beef market could be one of the
  bright spots for U.S. agricultural exports,"" said Philip Seng,
  Asian Director for the Federation. ""We supply and they (Japan)
  buy a very high quality of beef. They like our beef and want to
  buy more,"" he said.
      Seng pointed to Japan's beef quota system, which limits
  total Japanese beef imports to 177,000 tonnes per year and U.S.
  imports to 58,400 tonnes, as the major constraint in expanding
  U.S. beef shipments to Japan.
      The quotas were implemented in 1977 at a time of heavy
  Japanese foreign beef imports. The current quota agreement
  expires next March and beef quota negotiations are set to get
  underway this fall.
      The Reagan administration has called for an end to the
  quotas by April, 1988, but Japanese officials have said they
  would not liberalize imports regardless of the U.S. pressure.
      Officials from the Meat Export Federation told Reuters that
  they do not expect a complete lifting of the quota, but that
  they hope for at least a gradual increase in the quota.
      High beef prices in Japan caused by the protected market
  has also kept beef consumption at modest levels, meat industry
  officials said.
      Japanese shoppers pay an average of 27.14 dlrs for a U.S.
  tenderloin steak in a restaurant and an average of 47.42 dlrs
  for a Japanese-produced restaurant steak, the meat association
  said. At the retail level, U.S. striploin sells for 9.77 dlrs
  per pound, while Japanese beef sells for 28.51 dlrs per lb.
      Japanese consumers currently eat less than 10 lbs of beef
  per year, compared to 78 lbs for the average American,
  officials said.
      Total beef consumption in Japan is now 700,000 to 800,000
  tonnes per year, but Seng said with the removal of quotas and a
  decrease in beef prices, consumption could increase to 3.2 mln
  tonnes.

['acq'],"TALKING POINT/BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES &lt;BUR>
  The largest U.S. textile maker focused
  on its own business as its competitors found merger partners,
  but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself
  into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said.
      The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose
  4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and
  Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct
  stake.
      A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly
  acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover
  offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for
  Montreal-based Dominion called the report just ""rumors.""
      Burlington said it did not know if the report was true.
      Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of
  the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if
  Burlington actually came into play.
      Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however,
  added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it
  was looking for a takeover in the U.S.
      Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills
  and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for
  a U.S. acquisition.
      A Dominion spokesman said Canada's largest textile producer
  has been negotiating with ""many"" U.S. textile companies, but
  would not say whether Burlington was among them.
      ""There have been acquisitions in this area. It's not
  unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the
  housecleaning they've done,"" said Eileen Gormley of Thomson
  McKinnon.
      Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets
  and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs
  last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its
  operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign
  competition, Gormley said.
      ""They've pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,""
  said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial
  fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets
  and other fabric to the auto industry.
      ""In the past, they just spent and never realized the return
  on the outlays they did make,"" she said.
      ""You look at their record over the year, and I think
  they're poised to be more profitable than they had been in the
  past,"" Gormley said.
       She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up
  from 2.01 dlrs per share.
      Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington
  at its current levels.
      Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends
  selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50
  dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings
  basis.
      Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been
  placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share.
      ""After Asher's (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people
  don't find him very credible anymore,"" said one arbitrager.
      Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing
  managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if
  he doesn't win the target company.
      Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky
  Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying
  Ponderosa Inc.
      The stocks of other textile makers rose along with
  Burlington.
      J.P. Stevens &lt;STN> climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest
  Cannon Inc &lt;FLD>, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and
  Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc &lt;WPM>

  A group of Latin American and
  Caribbean nations formally opposed trade legislation pending in
  Congress, saying it would curb their exports, slow development
  and hinder its ability to repay foreign debt.
      Mario Rodriguez Montero, president of an Organization of
  American States special committee on trade, said he was aware
  of the large U.S. trade deficit, but added ""the region should
  not be the one affected by the trade bills.""
      He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollar
  and the budget deficit, and ""it is regrettable to solve it by a
  trade bill that would only serve private U.S. interests.""
      Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after two
  days of meetings with U.S. officials on trade bills now in
  Congress that are designed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit,
  which last year hit a record 166.3 billion dlrs.
      Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly at
  Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and a few other nations with large,
  annual trade surpluses with the United States.
      Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nations
  with large trade surpluses last year with the United States,
  but even Mexico, with the largest, had a surplus of only 5.2

['interest'],"LAWSON SAYS SOME COUNTRIES COULD CUT RATES
  Nigel Lawson, Britain's Chancellor of
  the Exchequer, said some countries may need to cut interest
  rates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability.
      Speaking to journalists one day after the Group of Seven
  countries reaffirmed goals set in Paris six weeks ago, he said
  central banks would continue to intervene ""as and when
  necessary.""
      He said the G-7 countries were concerned that Japan do more
  to stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined by
  Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday.
      Lawson said he was still worried about  the risk of a
  simultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and West
  Germany, though less so than when he gave his March 17 budget
  speech to the British Parliament.
      ""If anything I'm a little bit less concerned, but there is
  still a risk,"" he said.
      Asked if the United States should consider increasing
  interest rates to support the dollar, he said, ""If there is a
  need for changes in relative interest rates, it doesn't need to
  be a rise in interest rates in the United States.""
      Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday's
  meetings at the slow progress the United States had made in
  reducing its budget deficit.
      ""We believe there will be some worthwhile progress in
  reducing the deficit this year. The important thing is that it
  continue year after year,"" Lawson said.
      The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts to
  stabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the six
  weeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise against
  the dollar despite massive central bank intervention.
      Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in
  the Louvre accord, he said, ""I don't think so. If there had been
  no intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness.""
      Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawson
  said, ""the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode
  ... but one has to be vigilant.""
      He said yesterday's G-7 statement, which affirmed that
  ""current levels"" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been
  ""carefully worded."" ""We know what we mean, and we all mean the
  same thing,"" he said.
      Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanese
  measures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source of
  weakness for that agreement.
      Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa's
  presentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate
  domestic demand.
      They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate
  increase in public works spending, but Lawson said the package
  also involved a second stage to increase expenditures during
  the second half of this year.

['money-fx'],"POEHL LOOKS SET FOR EIGHT MORE YEARS AT BUNDESBANK
  For currency dealers Karl Otto Poehl is
  the scourge of speculators, for bankers he is the man who has
  played a key role in shaping the world's financial destiny for
  the last seven years, and for Germans he is the guardian of the
  mark.
      President of the powerful and independent West German
  central bank, the Bundesbank, Poehl is likely to have his
  contract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the
  end of this year, government officials say.
      (Index of economic spotlights, see page ECRA)
      But no official announcement has yet been made, raising
  eyebrows in West Germany's business community.
      The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in top
  ministerial posts under the Social Democrats, now in
  opposition, before he moved to the Bundesbank.
      There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohl
  would try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his own
  Christian Democrats. But officials noted that Poehl has worked
  closely and successfully with Finance Minister Gerhard
  Stoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982.
      Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from Paul
  Volcker of the United States, enjoys a strong international
  reputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up.
      Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlook
  Poehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat Chancellor
  Willy Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he was
  Finance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, as
  Chancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980.
      In recent months, with the mark's strong rise against the
  dollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of
  the Bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institution
  which has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent
  inflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two bouts
  of galloping inflation this century.
      But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, and
  inflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safe
  to relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the
  dangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate.
      ""I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the
  dollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for the
  Bundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the mark
  would endanger the economy in West Germany,"" he told business
  journalists in Frankfurt recently.
      Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says that
  Poehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy.
      ""Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does not
  focus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the external
  economy,"" she said.
      An economist at a German bank, who declined to be
  identified, said ""If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it will
  certainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so
  rigidly oriented towards money supply.""
      One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been to
  persuade the United States to stop ""talking down"" the dollar. For
  Poehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that
  the United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise
  currencies.
      The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency
  dealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But in
  fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact.
      ""This is because the markets know - or perhaps because they
  don't know - what the central banks can do,"" Poehl says of
  intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates
  round, making a speculator's position worthless.
      Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist
  in the 1960s before starting his ministerial career.
      A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over
  a glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker.
      He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and
  play golf.
      Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute
  for correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced.
      ""But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount
  if you strike at the right moment,"" he said. Bundesbank dealers
  are very professional and skilled. ""They've burnt the fingers of
  many people,"" he said. And unlike the speculators, Poehl notes,
  the Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit.

['crude'],"KUWAIT SEES OPEC OUTPUT OVER CEILING TO END-YEAR
  OPEC output for the second half of 1987,
  including that of Iraq, will be above the official 16.6 mln
  barrels per day (bpd) output ceiling agreed by OPEC Saturday,
  Kuwait oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said.
      Iraq refused to sign the pact, by which OPEC maintained its
  ceiling at 16.6 mln bpd for both the third and fourth quarters
  of 1987. In December, OPEC set a provisional fourth quarter
  level of 18.3 mln bpd, now cut back to the third quarter
  target.
      Ali told a news conference that including Iraq, ""OPEC third
  quarter output will be between 17.5 and 17.7 mln bpd while
  fourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd""
      Ali did not detail what effect he thought these production
  levels would have on prices.
      Iraq has an official first half quota of 1.466 mln bpd,
  rising to 1.54 mln in the second half, but has refused to
  adhere to it and has recently been producing around two mln
  barrels per day, exporting it through pipelines to Saudi Arabia
  and Turkey. Iraq's export capacity will be further boosted when
  a 500,000 bpd oil pipeline via Turkey comes on stream in about
  September.
      Iraq has been insisting on a quota equal to its Gulf War
  enemy Iran, which has a quota of 2.255 mln bpd, rising to 2.369
  mln in the second half.
      Ali said the position of the 400,000 bpd production from
  the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which has
  been supplied to Iraq as war relief crude, was fixed. ""We will
  not discuss it. There will not be any change,"" he said.
      Ali said the conference, which began Thursday and ended
  Saturday evening, had been too short for all necessary problems
  to be adressed. ""We are overdoing it in holding too short a
  meeting. We sweep a lot under the carpet,"" he said.
      Ali said the problem of price differentials between the
  prices of various OPEC crudes had not been dealt with properly
  at the meeting.
  
      Ali said ""The problem of differentials is a real one. I
  would hate to be producing today a light crude and that problem
  has not been dealt with properly. Light crudes are overpriced
  relative to heavy crudes.""
      Asked if the issue of differentials would be raised at the
  next OPEC meeting to be held in Vienna on December 9, Ali said
  ""If my crudes are affected I will raise the issue, I will not do
  the work of another minister.""
      Kuwait's own crudes range from medium to heavy grades.
      OPEC reintroduced fixed prices on February 1, with a spread
  of 2.65 dlrs a barrel between its lightest and heaviest crudes.

      A Dayton Hudson spokeswoman would not identify the buyer,

      The Wall Street sources said the Dart Group is expected

      According to the letter to company employess, Dayton Hudson

['crude'],"AMPLE SUPPLIES LIMIT U.S. STRIKE'S OIL PRICE IMPACT
  Ample supplies of OPEC crude weighing on
  world markets helped limit and then reverse oil price gains
  that followed the U.S. Strike on an Iranian oil platform in the
  Gulf earlier on Monday, analysts said.
      December loading rose to 19.65 dlrs, up 45 cents before
  falling to around 19.05/15 later, unchanged from last Friday.
      ""Fundamentals are awful,"" said Philip Lambert, analyst with
  stockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson, adding that total OPEC
  production in the first week of October could be above 18.5 mln
  bpd, little changed from September levels.
      Peter Nicol, analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, said OPEC
  production could be about 18.5-19.0 mln in October. Reuter and
  International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC September
  production at 18.5 mln bpd.
      The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit of
  a Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the Sea
  Isle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian,
  in Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flag
  commercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war.
      The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the
  area on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile.
      Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on
  Monday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S.
  Attack, analysts said.
      They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through which
  around eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not in
  the interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said.
      Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in
  the number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf
  hostilities, analysts said.
      But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranian
  missile attacks, with some describing it as responsible.
      Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew,
  said he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response.
      ""The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspond
  to Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that any
  further action will be met with a like-for-like response.
  Today's action by the U.S. Was not escalatory,"" Pyne said.
      Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the U.S. Strike was ""a
  responsible retaliation,"" with the U.S. Apparently indicating to
  Iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran
  chose to raise the level of conflict.
      Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view, however.
      He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved as
  Arab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose interests
  the U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as a
  result of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranian
  retaliation.
      The initial upward market move this morning reflected a
  strong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack which
  was thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile
  launchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said.
      The later downtrend followed confirmation of a U.S. Navy
  attack on an Iranian oil platform by the U.S. Defence Secretary
  Caspar Weinburger.
      Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the
  Gulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it less
  serious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower,
  analysts and traders said.

"['interest', 'money-fx']","BUNDESBANK SEES NO CHANGE IN MONETARY COURSE
  The Bundesbank sees no current reason
  to change monetary course, vice-president Helmut Schlesinger
  told Reuters in a telephone interview.
      Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks
  yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West
  Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which, dealers
  said, revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts
  may once again be under discussion.
      Schlesinger said he had no comment on the remarks of his
  two central bank council colleagues.
      But he added that the last central bank council meeting on
  April 2 had discussed the economic situation with a mood of
  ""subdued optimism,"" particularly influenced by the news brought
  by several state central bank presidents.
      ""Much is going better than the impression gained by the
  public from the January figures, which have been in the
  meantime superseded,"" he said.
      German January industrial output fell 3.0 pct after a
  decline of 0.9 pct in December. New industry orders fell 1.9
  pct after they had been unchanged in December.
      Bank economists said that the two together showed the
  economy would either stagnate or contract in the first quarter
  of 1987.
      Aside from the economic developments, Schlesinger added, a
  steady monetary course was important to hold the dollar/mark
  rate around current levels as Bundesbank president Karl Otto
  Poehl had said while attending the Washington World Bank/IMF
  meeting.
      Asked, however, if the Bundesbank could move to cut rates
  on repurchase agreements at the setting of the next repurchase
  tender, due next Tuesday, Schlesinger said, ""Since the central
  bank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14
  days, this is hardly probable.""
      Responding to the question whether the Bundesbank had moved
  away from a policy of targetting monetary growth toward one of
  targetting currency rates, Schlesinger said he could have no
  comment on the subject while negotiations were still in
  progress in Washington.

"
['tin'],"TIN TRADERS' RESPONSE MUTED TO KL FUTURES MARKET
  European free market tin traders made a
  somewhat muted response to plans for a Kuala Lumpur
  dollar-based tin futures market due to be launched in October.
      Traders said the new market would probably be a useful
  trading medium for Japan and other South East Asian tin
  interests although European traders generally appear to be
  reasonably satisfied with the current ""free market"" system
  which has been operating since London Metal Exchange, LME, tin
  trading ceased in October 1985. Dealers here will also want to
  see how acceptable foreign metal will be on the new market and
  what sort of demand develops for forward deliveries.
      There is also a view among European traders that, while the
  proposed Kuala Lumpur tin futures market would provide another
  useful reference point, a market inaugurated by the Malaysian
  government -- in the past viewed as a major player at times by
  the trade -- would make participants uncomfortable.
      Some traders expressed a preference for a resumption of
  trading on the London Metal Exchange, but they added that while
  there has been some behind the scenes discussion on the subject
  a definite move is unlikely until outstanding High Court
  litigation actions have been resolved.
      Spot tin prices on the European free market are currently
  around 4,200 stg per tonne for high grade metal in warehouse
  Rotterdam. Over the past 18 months the price moved to a ten
  year low of 3,400 stg in March 1986 and rebounded to as high as
  4,680 stg in December 1986.
      This compares with 8,140 stg last paid when LME trading
  ceased in October 1985 and a record high tin price of 10,350
  stg traded for Cash Standard Grade metal in June of that year.
      LME warehouse stocks are now near a two-year low at 28,065
  tonnes, having fallen steadily from a record high of 72,485
  tonnes reached in February 1986.
      Traders said the free market turned bullish during late
  last year based on producer forecasts of a supply/demand
  deficit of some 28,000/29,000 tonnes. Analysts were predicting
  prices of up to 5,000 stg per tonne during 1987.
      However, the trend was reversed following a strong upswing
  in sterling versus the dollar and values fell back briefly to
  4,100 stg last month after approaching 4,700 stg in December.
      The decline accelerated as producers who had sold very
  little metal at the higher levels became competitive sellers.
      There was also a lack of significant demand from major
  steel mills who made large purchases prior to the new year.
      Traders say the 15 ITC creditor banks' original tin
  holdings of nearly 45,000 tonnes have now been almost halved,
  and the bulk of material still available is being held by
  Malaysian and Japanese firms which are reluctant to depress the
  market with unwanted metal.
      Some 80,000 tonnes were held by banks and brokers after the
  International Tin Council's, ITC, buffer stock manager halted
  support operations on the LME on behalf of the 22 members
  nations of the International Tin Agreement.
      The overhang of metal was reduced further by broker
  Shearson Lehman Brothers, which earlier this year reported
  having sold its ITC-related holdings and halved its overall tin
  position.
      Analysts see no immediate sign of a rally in European tin
  prices and movements are still expected to be largely related
  to currency fluctuations, unless significant consumer demand
  emerges for the third quarter.
      The Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC, has made
  efforts since the collapse of the ITA to achieve higher world
  prices by attempting to bring all major producers under an
  export control umbrella, but to date Brazil and China, two
  major producers, remain unaffected by the ATPC argument and
  apparently are continuing to offer material at discounts to
  consumers in main European trading centres, dealers said.

  The Tanzanian government, in its
  second annual budget since embarking on an economic recovery
  program inspired by the International Monetary Fund, announced
  increases in fuel prices and sales tax and higher levies on
  government services.
      Finance Minister Cleopa Msuya said the government expected
  to spend 77.33 billion shillings in the financial year 1987/8,
  39 pct more than this year's estimate. Revenue would provide
  48.84 billion shillings, leaving a deficit of 28.49 billion to
  be financed through domestic and foreign loans.
      This year's budget initially projected a deficit of only
  3.35 billion shillings but in mid-year the government had to
  impose new taxes to keep the deficit roughly on target. No
  figure for the final deficit was avaialble.
      The budget gave civil servants a 20 pct pay rise with
  effect from July 1, to compensate for inflation of more than 30
  pct.

"['crude', 'ship']","LATEST ATTACK SEEN POINTING UP DILEMMAS FOR US
  Military experts say the United States
  faces a dilemma in the Gulf following U.S. destruction of an
  Iranian oil platform in retaliation for an attack on a
  U.S.-flagged tanker.
      The experts told Reuters Tehran holds the initiative and is
  likely to control the tempo and direction of the conflict as
  long as America simply reacts to Iranian attacks by launching
  limited retaliatory strikes.
      But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps
  -- such as mining Iran's harbors, blockading its shipping, or
  destroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war.
      ""Iran is in the driver's seat in an absolute sense as the
  cycle of attack and retaliation continues,"" said Fred Axelgard,
  a Gulf War expert with the private Center for Strategic and
  International Studies (CSIS).
      ""It's like a Greek tragedy,"" said retired Adm. Eugene Carroll
  of Washington's private Center for Defense Information (CDI)
  think tank.
      Some Middle East experts say the only way out is for
  Washington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end to
  the war between Iran and Iraq.
      They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its
  30-ship force from the Gulf area, where the Navy began
  escorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July. Withdrawal 
  would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran, which
  President Reagan could never accept.
      U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagon
  news conference the destroyers Kidd, Young, Leftwich and Hoel
  fired about 1,000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran's Rostam
  oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulf
  time (0700 EDT) on Monday.
      Weinberger said the platform had been used as a military
  base by Iran and that the attack responded to an Iranian
  Silkworm missile strike on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea
  Isle City on Friday.
      Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance and
  allowed to escape.
      ""We do not seek further confrontation with Iran, but we will
  be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran
  with stronger countermeasures,"" Weinberger said.
      ""We consider this matter closed,"" he said.
      Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservatives
  agreed the U.S. reaction was measured, reasonable and did not
  escalate the conflict unduly. But they said the question was
  whether Iran would consider the matter closed. It had not taken
  this view after earlier clashes.

  The Soviet Union has agreed to supply
  Iran with refined oil products in exchange for 100,000 barrels
  per day of crude, Iran's national news agency, IRNA, said.
      IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Oil Minister Gholamreza
  Aqazadeh as saying on his return to Tehran from Moscow that the
  agreement was part of a protocol on economic cooperation signed
  during his visit. The amount of crude delivered to the Soviet
  Union might double to 200,000 bpd later, he said.
      Aqazadeh said the two sides agreed to conduct feasibility
  studies for a pipeline to take Iranian crude from fields in
  southern Iran to the Black Sea through the Soviet Union.
      Iran is pursuing the pipeline project to protect part of
  its oil exports from Iraqi air attacks in the Gulf.
      Irna made no mention of natural gas exports to the Soviet
  Union, which Aqazadeh had said would be discussed before he
  left for Moscow.
      Iran lost most of its refining capacity early in the Gulf
  war and now imports several hundred thousand bpd of refined
  products.
      Aqazadeh said Soviet refined products would be delivered at
  the Caspian Sea ports of Anzali and Nowshahr, at Neka, near the
  Caspian, and at Jolfa in north-west Iran.

['cocoa'],"DUTCH COCOA PROCESSORS UNHAPPY WITH ICCO BUFFER
  Dutch cocoa processors are unhappy with
  the intermittent buying activities of the International Cocoa
  Organization's buffer stock manager, industry sources told
  Reuters.
      ""The way he is operating at the moment is doing almost
  nothing to support the market. In fact he could be said to be
  actively depressing it,"" one company spokesman said.
      Including the 3,000 tonnes he acquired on Friday, the total
  amount of cocoa bought by the buffer stock manager since he
  recently began support operations totals 21,000 tonnes.
      Despite this buying, the price of cocoa is well under the
  1,600 Special Drawing Rights, SDRs, a tonne level below which
  the bsm is obliged to buy cocoa off the market.
      ""Even before he started operations, traders estimated the
  manager would need to buy at least up to his 75,000 tonnes
  maximum before prices moved up to or above the 1,600 SDR level,
  and yet he appears reluctant to do so,"" one manufacturer said.
      ""We all hoped the manager would move into the market to buy
  up to 75,000 tonnes in a fairly short period, and then simply
  step back,"" he added.
      ""The way the manager is only nibbling at the edge of the
  market at the moment is actually depressing sentiment and the
  market because everyone is holding back from both buying and
  selling waiting to see what the manager will do next,"" one
  processor said.
      ""As long as his buying tactics remain the same the market is
  likely to stay in the doldrums, and I see no indication he is
  about to alter his methods,"" he added.
      Processors and chocolate manufacturers said consumer prices
  for cocoa products were unlikely to be affected by buffer stock
  buying for some time to come.

  despite the halt of shipments to the U.S., Company spokesmen

      They said the voluntary restraints were aimed at averting

  feared Japanese personal computers would flood EC markets after
  Washington imposed 100 pct tariffs last April.
      Toshiba and Sharp together control about 40 pct of the

      Toshiba said exports of T1100 and T3100 lap-top computers

      Sharp said exports to the EC of PC 7000 series lap-top
  personal computers would continue at last year's level of
  12,000 to 16,000 units a year.
      Washington imposed the tariffs because of Japan's alleged

  U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
  has asked Japan to open its farm market further to help

  pressures, an Agriculture Ministry official told reporters.
      Hideo Maki, Director General of the ministry's Economic
  Affairs Bureau, quoted Lyng as telling Agriculture Minister
  Mutsuki Kato that the removal of import restrictions would help
  Japan as well as the United States.
      The meeting with Kato opened a 12-day visit to Japan by
  Lyng, who is here to dicuss farm trade.
      However, Maki quoted Kato as replying that Japan was
  already the world's largest grain importer.
      Kato added Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Grain and
  depended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its food
  requirements in 1985.
      Lyng said the U.S. Put high priority on talks on 12 farm
  products named in U.S. Complaints against Japan to the General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year, as well as on
  beef, citrus products and rice.
      Kato said Japan will maintain its current level of
  self-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus rice
  because potential production is higher than domestic demand.
      The world farm market suffers from surpluses because of
  rising production by exporting countries, he added.
      Lyng said the U.S. Has been trying to reduce farm product
  output with expensive programs, Maki said.
      Maki said the U.S. And Japan will hold detailed discussions

  The government should cut its consumer

      Kondo said after a cabinet meeting that consumers should

  The Brazilian Coffee Institute
  (IBC) has given shippers until close of business on Thursday to
  submit details of past export performance in order that
  individual quotas can be allocated, an IBC spokesman said.
      He told Reuters IBC President Jorio Dauster has confirmed
  acceptance of National Coffee Policy Council (CNPC) proposals
  to establish individual export quotas based 65 pct on export
  performance, 25 pct on stocks and 10 pct by auction.
      Shippers can choose their best period of 12 consecutive
  months between April 1, 1985, and September 30, 1987, to be
  used for calculating the export performace portion.
      The IBC will total all the figures, calculate each shippers
  participation and use this as a basis for allocation of
  individual quotas, the IBC spokesman said.
      He said the IBC has already settled with the Sao Paulo
  Mercantile Exchange how the auction system will operate.
  Shippers can bid a premium over the contribution quota payable
  on coffee exports and the succesful bidder will add this
  premium to the contribution quota when he submits his export
  sales declaration form.
      Auctions will not start until after the opening of export
  registrations. The spokesman could not say when this might be
  but trade sources said an announcement could come at the end of
  the week, opening registraions from Monday.
      A meeting has been set for tomorrow in Brasilia of the
  CNPC's export marketing committee to establish a system for
  allocating the 25 pct of export quotas based on stock levels,
  the spokesman added.
      A system of individual export quotas is being reestablished
  in Brazil - a previous system was abandoned in 1985 - to ensure
  shipments are kept in line with the country's ICO quota.

['interest'],"BUDGET CHIEF MILLER WARNS FED ON INTEREST RATES
  White House Budget chief James
  Miller said he was concerned that the Federal Reserve might
  ""overreact"" to the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar by
  raising interest rates, a move he said could cause a recession
  next year.
      ""Our greatest danger is overreaction,"" Miller told newspaper
  reporters yesterday. ""I'm concerned about the Fed's
  overreaction. I'm concerned about what I see in recent data
  showing a substantial fall in the money supply.""
      Edwin Dale, Miller's spokesman, said the remarks, published
  in the New York Times today, were accurate.
      Miller said he was concerned the Fed might overreact to
  signals of rising inflation by tightening credit -- a move he
  said could have ""political consequences.""
      The White House budget chief appeared to be referring to
  the effect an economic slowdown could have on the presidential
  and congressional elections next year.
      ""My fear is that if we get into a recession we are in deep
  soup, and there is no question about it,"" he said.
      Miller said an economic slowdown could lead to lower tax
  revenues and a widening of the budget deficit.
      Miller's remarks reflected concern that the U.S. central
  bank might feel compelled to tighten credit as a means of
  bolstering the dollar.
      Both Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve
  Board Chairman Paul Volcker recently have warned that further
  declines in the value of the U.S. dollar could jeopardize
  global growth prospects.
      U.S. officials have urged Japan and West Germany to
  stimulate economic growth in their countries -- a move that
  could boost U.S. exports and relieve trade protectionist
  pressures in the United States.

      Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for

  increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies,
  a practice discouraged by the IMF.

  Weekend rain over the Western Corn Belt
  brought further relief to crop areas that had been dry earlier

  moisture to central and eastern belt locations this week,
  according to Dale Mohler, senior meteorologist for Accu-Weather
  Inc.
      ""There is going to be more rain for the next two, three
  days,"" he said. ""We're in a fairly wet pattern with normal to
  above normal moisture this week.""
      Mohler said rainfall averaged 1/2 inch across southern
  Minnesota, 3/4 inch over southwest Iowa, one inch in eastern
  Nebraska and 1-1/2 inches in south-central Nebraska.
      Illinois fields saw virtually no rain over the weekend but
  were receiving scattered thundershower activity today, he said.
      Rain patterns will move across Indiana to Ohio with
  thudershower activity yielding to more general rains, he said.
      ""Tomorrow, that eastern area will get 1/4 to one inch, a

  early-developed corn moves into the crucial pollination stage

['trade'],"REAGAN TO ANNOUNCE DECISION ON JAPAN SANCTIONS
  President Reagan today is to
  announce a decision on tough new tariffs on Japanese exports to
  retaliate for what he calls Japan's failure to end its unfair
  practices in semiconductor trade.
      The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs of
  Japanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel of
  experts headed by the U.S. Trade Representative's Office.
      Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffs
  on certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computors
  and television sets to power tools and photographic film.
      The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some
  20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to Santa
  Barbara, where Reagan is vacationing.
      In his March annoucement, Reagan said ""I am committed to
  full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide
  American industry with free and fair trade opportunities.""
      He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored the
  pact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in world
  markets and opened its home market to U.S. products.
      U.S. officials said Japan had done nothing since the March
  announcement to alter Reagan's plan to invoke the sanctions.
      White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday:  ""we
  do not want a trade war, but we feel that this is the kind of
  action that requires meaningful action.""
      Reagan's move follows steadily rising U.S. trade deicits,
  with last year's hitting a record $169.8 billion.
      About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan.
      Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president to
  retaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices.
      He has opposed the legislation, saying it would prevent
  negotiated solutions to trade disputes and, in any case, that
  existing law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices.
      Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese was
  as much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did not
  need any new trade legislation.
      The Japanese have complained that they have been honoring
  the semiconductor pact, but that it would take time before the
  results showed up.
      U.S. officials, however, have said their monitoring of
  Japanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries and
  Western Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that the
  Japanese home markets remained shut to American exports.
      Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs, it would
  file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade
  (GATT).
      It said hoped GATT would find the U.S. retaliation had
  violated the regulations of the global trading group and would
  approve compensation or Japanese retaliation.
      U.S. officials have said they did not think Japan would
  retaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war with
  the United States.

"['gold', 'silver']","LITTLE REACTION TO COMEX PRICE LIMIT REMOVAL
  The elimination of price limits on
  precious metals contracts trading at the Commodity Exchange in
  New York appears to be having little effect on the market,
  analysts said.
      ""There is nothing apparent from the change,"" said William
  O'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc.
  ""The market has not approached the old price limits and trading
  is relative quiet, in narrow ranges,"" he added.
      Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs on
  market moves in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker
  in the nearby contracts amid thin conditions, traders said.
      On May 5, COMEX did away with price limits on the two
  contracts following spot after a volatile market in silver
  futures at the end of April caused severe disruptions.
      During the last week of April, silver futures traded up and
  down the price limit in the back months, causing traders to
  rush into the spot contract to offset those moves, analysts
  said.  As a result, Elders' O'Neill said, there was much
  confusion, many unmatched trades, and large losses.
      The COMEX fined Elders Futures and three other large firms
  a total of 100,000 dlrs for failure to resolve unmatched trades
  in a timely manner.
      Silver futures were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the
  nearby contracts amid quiet trading today.
      O'Neill said the elimination of price limits on all COMEX
  metals futures would add caution to trading since all contracts
  could move any distance.
      ""This is amore realistic approach because the metals market
  is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,""
  O'Neill said.
      Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers,
  said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panic
  buying or selling  and contribute to more orderly markets.

"['dlr', 'money-fx', 'trade']","U.S. TRADE DATA SEEN AS KEY TO DOLLAR TREND
  The dollar's recent signs of stability
  have raised hopes that its 27-month decline may be nearly over,
  but most currency analysts refuse to commit themselves until
  after the June 12 release of U.S. trade data for April.
      ""The trade data will be a deciding factor to see if the
  dollar has bottomed out,"" said Jim McGroarty of Discount Corp.
      Since February 1985, the dollar has nearly halved its value
  against the yen and the mark as part of an officially
  orchestrated campaign to make U.S. goods more competitive on
  world markets and redress gaping world trade imbalances.
      On April 27, the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 137.25 yen
  but has enjoyed a modest recovery over the last few weeks,
  topping 145 yen today for the first time in nearly two months.
      Many economists now believe that the dollar has fallen far
  enough to ease the trade deficit's drag on the U.S. economy.
      The U.S. trade gap narrowed to 13.6 billion dlrs in March
  from 15.1 billion in February and is expected to show continued
  improvement in April in volume, if not in real, terms.
      Keiichi Udagawa of Bank of Tokyo in New York said that if
  further progress is reported, the dollar would head back up
  towards 150 yen.
      ""There is growing consensus that the dollar has bottomed
  out for the medium term,"" added Tom Campbell of First National
  Bank of Chicago.
      Other factors supporting this bullish view were growing
  expectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker would
  be reappointed for a third four-year term in August, Japan's
  larger-than-expected economic stimulus package last week and 
  more favorably technical chart signals, analysts said.
      The dollar was also aided by Japan's moves to dampen
  speculative selling in Tokyo and by reports of active central
  bank intervention to support the dollar.
      The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said last week that
  the U.S. monetary authorities bought more than four billion
  dlrs during the February-April period -- the largest amount
  since the dollar crisis of the late 1970's.
      Discount Corp's McGroarty described the Fed's intervention
  volume as ""impressive"".
      James O'Neill of Marine Midland Bank was not so positive,
  however: ""the dollar has not yet bottomed out. After the trade
  data are released, the dollar could fall towards 1.77 marks and
  140 yen.""
      Similarly, Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank in New York
  warned, ""I don't think the dollar has bottomed out yet.""
      Although the dollar could rise as high as 146.50 yen, Okada
  said market impatience about the painstakingly slow decline of
  the U.S. trade deficit may lead to renewed pressure.
      Currency analysts also warned about an unfavorable reaction
  to the seven-nation economic Summit on June 8 to 10 in Venice,
  which is likely to focus on the implementation of previous
  commitments rather than yield any fresh initiatives.
      President Reagan said today, ""economic policy decisions
  made last year in Tokyo and at this year's meetings of Group of
  Seven finance ministers in Paris and Washington cannot be
  ignored or forgotten.""
      ""The commitments made at these meetings need to be
  translated into action,"" he added in a speech, celebrating the
  40th anniversary of the Marshall aid plan for Europe.
      Now that Tokyo has unveiled its fiscal stimulus package,
  analysts expected Bonn and the dollar/mark rate to bear the
  brunt of U.S. calls for further action.
      Marine Midland's O'Neill said, ""pressure will build up on
  Germany to take stimulative action like Japan.""
      Some Japanese bank dealers warned that although the dollar
  could hold above 145 yen for some months it could also come
  under attack again if it seems the latest economic package is
  not having much impact on Japan's economy and its trade
  surplus. Reflecting a longer-term uncertainty, some some trust
  banks and Japanese insurers are keeping their short dollar
  positons hedged against exchange losses in their foreign
  portfolios, while some others have started covering those short
  positions, Japanese bank dealers said.

['crude'],"NORWAY BOOSTS OIL OUTPUT BY 22 PCT IN SEPTEMBER
  Norway's September oil output rose by 22.2
  pct to 1.07 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 830,492 bpd in
  August, according to a Reuter survey of firms operating here.
      Operators said the sharp rise reflected higher output at
  several of Norway's biggest fields and resumed production at
  fields shut down for 27 days in August for the Ekofisk field
  rescue project.
      Industry analysts said the increase did not exceed Norway's
  voluntary move to curb by 7.5 pct planned growth in its oil
  output, a move designed to back OPEC-led efforts to stabilise
  oil prices by limiting supplies to world crude markets.
      Norway, not an OPEC member, decided in June to extend the
  production restraints, enforced since February 1 1987, on all
  its North Sea fields for the rest of the year.
      Oil Minister Arne Oeien said last month he expected Norway
  would extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth.
      The biggest increase was seen on the Ekofisk field, which
  pumped 168,023 bpd in September against 48,195 bpd in August,
  field operator Phillips Petroleum Norway Inc said.
      Ekofisk and the nearby Valhall and Ula fields, which use
  the Ekofisk pipeline, were shut down for most of August while
  Phillips raised Ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence.
      BP Petroleum Development Norway Ltd, operator of the Ula
  field, said September output rose to 86,727 bpd after dropping
  to 27,237 bpd in August because of the shutdown.
      Valhall, operated by Amoco Norway A/S, flowed 74,694 bpd
  last month compared with 69,748 bpd in August, the company
  said.
      September production was also sharply higher at the
  Statfjord field. Norway's 84 pct share of Statfjord, which
  extends into the British North Sea sector, was 611,138 bpd
  against 552,646 bpd in August, operator Den Norske Stats
  Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) said.
      Norway's 22.2 pct share of the Murchison field which, like
  Statfjord, extends into the British sector, yielded 15,388 bpd
  in September, a slight 920 bpd decrease from the previous
  month, Norwegian partners on the British-operated field said.
      Statoil boosted output at its Gullfaks field to 109,670 bpd
  in September, compared with 100,188 in August.
      Norsk Hydro, operator of the Oseberg field, said test
  output at the field from the mobile production ship Petro Jarl
  totalled 1,719 bpd last month, down sharply from 16,170 bpd in
  August.
      Hydro said the drop was caused by failure to bring on
  stream a second well, cutting September production to just two
  days.

      Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers,
  Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased
  the chance that Congress will act to curb abuses.
      ""We are proposing legislation that would provide for more
  disclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and would

      Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the threshold
  for notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that a

  company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within
  10 days, Proxmire said.
      In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirement

  prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in
  knowing about coming takeover attempts.
      Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a
  tender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60
  business days from the current 20 business days.
      His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring
  company violated the time period on the tender offer.
      To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmire
  said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin
  requirments are properly enforced.
      The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirement
  for purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generally
  enforced in hostile takeovers.
      Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeover
  declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without
  actually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said.
      He said his bill would allow private suits for damages for
  failure to meet the Federal Reserve's 50 pct margin
  requirements.
      The bill also would require more disclose when several
  investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover.
      ""When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to know
  about it,"" Proxmire said.
      Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britain
  towards two-tiered tender offers that insures that all
  shareholders recieve equal treatment.
      He said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover
  defensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills.
      Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later this
  month and predicted the Senate committee would act this spring.
      He said he was hopeful Congress could pass a bill this

['nat-gas'],"COLUMBIA GAS &lt;CG> SEEKS CONTRACT COST RECOVERY
  Columbia Gas Transmission
  corp said it made an abbreviated, streamlined filing with the
  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to recover a portion if
  its costs of renegotiating high-cost gas purchase contracts.
      Recently, the Columbia Gas System Inc pipeline subsidiary
  said, FERC denied on procedural grounds and without prejudice a
  proposal to include these costs in the company's most recent
  purchased gas adjustment -- or PGA -- filing.
      Noting it has has asked for a rehearing on the denial
  ruling, Columbia Gas said it would withdraw its alternative
  filing if the commission grantes its request for a rehearing to
  include the contract renegotiation costs in its PGA or
  consolidates this issue in the pipeline's general rate filing
  and permit recovery, subject to refund, effective April one.
      The company said the alternative filing seeks to recover
  about 79 mln dlrs a year through the pipeline's non-gas sales
  commodity rates. This annual amortization amount is based on
  recovery of about 653 mln drls over an 8-1/4 year period,
  beginning April 1, 1987.
      Columbia Gas said the filing would increase the pipeline
  commodity rates by 15.74 cts per mln Btu to 2.95 dlrs per mln.
      The company said it orginially sought to include these
  costs in its PGA since the payments to products resulted in
  almost five billion dlrs in prospective price relief and were
  not related to take-or-pay buyout costs.
      It explained this interpretation was based on FERC's April
  10, 1985, Statement of Policy which said that only take-or-pay
  buyout costs must be recovered through a general rate filing
  under the Natural Gas Act.
      As a result of renegotiating contracts for high-cost gas,
  Columbia Gas said, it has been able to reduce the average price
  paid for gas purchased from Southwest producers to 1.96 dlrs
  per mln Btu in December 1986 from 3.64 dlrs per mln in April
  1985.
      The pipeline said Southwestern producers account for 46 pct
  of its total available gas supply this year.

  Ivory Coast rainfall this season has
  been less than in previous years, but 1986/87 cocoa and coffee
  production has not suffered, the official Ivorian daily
  Fraternite Matin reported.
      The newspaper did not speculate on whether recent dry
  conditions seriously threatened the main 1987/88 cocoa crop.
  Trade sources said the weather up to now could be irrelevant if
  there is good rainfall in coming weeks.
      Precipitation during the present campaign has been lowest
  in northern savannah regions, where the cotton crop has
  especially benefitted from the dry weather, Fraternite Matin

  compared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985/86.
      Fraternite Matin said the mainstays of Ivorian agriculture
  had been little affected by the dry weather. Coffee does not
  need very much water to survive and only old cocoa plants have
  been affected in some regions, it added.
      London-based dealer Gill and Duffus recently forecast
  1986/87 Ivory Coast cocoa output at a record 590,000 tonnes,

      The U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) earlier this year

"['cpi', 'gnp', 'money-supply']","GERMAN INSTITUTES WARN ON MONEY SUPPLY
  Four of West Germany's five leading
  economic research institutes warned that excessive monetary
  growth threatened a resurgence of inflation.
      But in a dissenting view the DIW institute in West Berlin,
  echoing recent statements by leading Bundesbank officials, said
  the expansion seen over the last 1-1/2 years did not
  necessarily threaten stability.
      The five institutes issued a joint spring report, in which
  three -- Kiel, Hamburg and Essen -- forecast a two pct rise in
  GNP in 1987, while West Berlin and Munich predicted one pct.
      The four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome in
  view of the slowdown in economic activity. But experience has
  shown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a price
  rise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy.
      Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears may
  seem exaggerated, they said.
      ""But it has often turned out in the past that the price
  climate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank into
  a restrictive policy,"" they said.
      The economic costs of a preventive stability policy are
  less than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said.
      The four institutes disputed the view that monetary
  expansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domestic
  investors switch liquidity into longer term capital market
  investments following lower interest rates.
      ""Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion of
  central bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to a
  smaller expansion of money supply,"" they said.
      A return to growth and stability did not require
  spectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly with
  open market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoid
  an interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations.
      The DIW institute said monetary policy should not be
  focused simply on growth of production potential. Because of
  uncertainty about exchange rate developments and economic
  weakness other factors should be taken into account.
      Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cuts
  and avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluation
  speculation. Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threat
  in itself to price stability.
      The 1979/81 inflation following strong 1977/78 money growth
  reflected other causes, such as rising oil prices and the
  falling mark.

['wpi'],"U.K. PRODUCER PRICES SEEN MOVED BY TECHNICALITIES
  U.K. Producer price data for March were
  roughly as expected after taking into account technical factors
  which affected the year-on-year outcome, economic analysts
  said.
      The figures showed a 0.3 pct provisional, non-seasonally
  adjusted rise in output prices in March, unchanged from
  February and close to the average for the last six months.
      The year-on-year rise was put at 3.7 pct, down from 4.2 pct
  in February.
      But Chris Tinker, economist at brokerage house Phillips and
  Drew, said the drop in the year-on-year rate mainly reflected a
  rise in excise duties which affected the index in March last
  year.
      He cautioned that it was dangerous to read too much into
  the monthly figure, adding that a rise of only 0.2 pct in April
  would take the year-on-year rise back above 4.2 pct.
      Analysts also noted that a drop in manufacturers' input
  prices was almost entirely due to anticipated seasonal factors
  such as a fall in industrial electricity costs.
      Duncan Squire of Lloyds Merchant Bank said the figures were
  slightly disappointing in that the strengthening of sterling
  had not yet reduced input prices as much as expected.
      Both he and Tinker said this factor should help keep input
  costs down over the next few months, although Tinker added that
  last year's fall in oil prices is now about to drop out of the
  year-on-year comparisons and is likely to lead to a return to
  rises in the index rather than falls.

  A specially convened Franco-German
  meeting in the sidelines of a summit of EC leaders failed to
  make any progress over a 1987-88 farm price package that has
  deeply split the two former EC allies, diplomats said
      The meeting was attended by farm ministers and foreign
  ministers from both countries and by French President Francois
  Mitterand, his Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, and by Chancellor
  Helmut Kohl of West Germany.
      The stalemate over farm prices is seen as a key to
  providing a solution to a long-term settlement of the
  Community's worst-ever budget crisis.
      ""The Germans clearly do not want to budge,"" an aide to Chirac
  told reporters. He added the French Prime Minister was visibly
  angered as he the hour-long meeting.
      Bonn and Paris are diametrically opposed to a proposal for
  the Brussels Executive Commission to overhaul radically the
  EC's complex ""green"" currrency system, designed to translate
  common EC farm prices into national currencies.
      Paris also supports a move for an oils and fats tax which
  West Germany is against, along with Britain, Denmark and the
  Netherlands.
      EC farm minsters are due to resume negotiations on the
  package, which should have been agreed by an April 1 deadline
  tomorrow.
      Diplomats said it had been hoped that the summit could have
  injected fresh impetus into those talks.
      The Commission proposed its package to save one billion
  dollars on the EC's ever-rising farm budget.
      The summit has been dominated by lengthy talks on moves to
  alter the entire system of financing the 12-nation group, and
  plugging a 5.7 billion dollar budget shortfall for 1987.

  Following are extracts from the

      ""The conference expressed satisfaction about the positive
  results of the agreement signed in December, 1986, by which
  OPEC re-established the system of fixed price at a level of 18
  dlrs per barrel supported by OPEC production ceilings
  distributed into national production levels.
      ""The conference noted that all market indicators, including
  spot prices in the market and netback values of all OPEC
  crudes, have been firming up significantly, thus consolidating
  the OPEC price structure as defined by the agreement.""
      ""The conference examined the supply/demand outlook for the
  second half of the year and decided that in order to secure
  continued firm prices in the market, OPEC production during the
  fourth quarter of 1987 will be equal to that of the third
  quarter, I.E. 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd), distributed into
  the same national production levels as were defined by the
  above-mentioned agreement for that quarter.""
      ""Furthermore, the conference decided to establish a
  committee of five heads of delegation to monitor the price
  evolution in the market in relation to the OPEC official prices
  in order to secure price stability around the opec price
  structure.
      ""Should there be any significant change in market prices,
  the committee would immediately call for an extraordinary
  meeting of the conference with a view to deciding on the
  necessary OPEC production levels during the second half of the
  year, which would secure the desired market stability.""
      ""The conference reiterated the necessity of member
  countries' strict adherence to the agreement signed in December
  1986, both in terms of official price, and national production,
  levels.
      ""For this purpose, the conference decided to establish a
  committee of three heads of delegation to undertake visits to
  member countries in order to motivate them to comply with the
  terms of the agreement.""
  
      ""Moreover, the conference stressed the necessity of the
  cooperation of the oil-producing exporting countries outside
  OPEC as an essential prerequisite for a lasting market
  stability.
      The conference, therefore, decided to reinstate the group
  of five heads of delegation established by the 77th
  (extraordinary) meeting of the conference in April, 1986 to
  undertake the necessary contacts with those countries.
      ""The conference observed the continued fall in the value of

['copper'],"ZAMBIAN COPPER INDUSTRY HOPES FOR STEADY OUTPUT
  Zambia's copper mining industry is hoping
  to achieve and maintain production at over 500,000 tonnes a
  year in the next few years despite low world prices,
  deteriorating ores and shortages of mine inputs, industry
  officials said.
      But Zambia's decision to abandon last May 1 a tough
  International Monetary Fund (IMF) economic recovery program has
  introduced an element of uncertainty into plans to restructure
  the ailing industry and boost profitability, they said.
      Copper production by the government-controlled Zambia
  Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) for the 1987 financial year
  ended March 31 improved slightly to about 471,000 tonnes from a
  record 1986 low of 463,354 tonnes.
      ""We are convinced that by the end of the 1988 financial
  year, copper production could well be over 500,000 tonnes due
  to greater availability of spares and equipment,"" a ZCCM
  official said.
      ZCCM officials said the production of cobalt, another
  strategic income earner, will also be tailored to meet demand.
      Finished production in 1986 was 4,565 tonnes, 911 tonnes
  higher than the previous year and the best production achieved
  to date.
      Protracted low world metal prices have badly hit the copper
  industry in Zambia, the world's fifth biggest producer. Mining
  is monopolised by ZCCM and accounts for about 90 pct of the
  country's foreign exchange earnings.
      Production has also been seriously affected in recent years
  by equipment breakdowns, deteriorating ore and shortages of
  spare parts, fuel and lubricants. The 463,354 tonnes output
  last year compared with a peak 1975 output of 700,000 tonnes.
      A five-year production and investment plan launched in 1984
  by ZCCM is being funded by the European Community, the African
  Development Bank and the World Bank.
      The plan foresees the shutdown of some seven mining and
  metallurgical units on the grounds they are unprofitable.
      ZCCM, the second largest employer after the government, has
  said it intends to lay off 20,000 of its 60,000 workforce as
  part of the plan.
      More than 250 mln dlrs have so far been channelled into the
  industry in a bid to improve efficiency and profitability under
  the five-year restructuring plan.
      Company officials said although reserves were being
  depleted, Zambia could continue to produce copper beyond the
  end of the century, though at lower levels of production.
      Industry sources said ZCCM's projected pre-tax profit for
  the financial year ended March 31 would be around 500 mln
  kwacha. But with the current mineral export tax level being
  levied, a net loss is likely to be registered.
      ZCCM recorded a net loss of 718 mln kwacha in 1986 compared
  with a net profit of 19 mln kwacha the year before.
      Under the foreign exchange auction system introduced in
  1985, ZCCM's profits from its foreign exchange earnings rose as
  the value of the kwacha fell to 21 to the dollar from just over
  two to the dollar.
      But on May 1, President Kenneth Kaunda abolished the
  auctioning system, inspired by the International Monetary Fund,
  and announced Zambia would pursue a go-it-alone economic
  strategy based on national resources.
      ZCCM officials are still cautious over what effects the
  break with the IMF will have on the industry's plans.
      ""We are still consulting to see how the new measures will
  affect us but it is too early to say just how we shall fare
  under the new situation,"" Peter Hansen, director of operations
  and third in the ZCCM hierarchy, told Reuters.
      Some analysts believe the new officially-fixed exchange
  rate of eight kwacha to the dollar will hit ZCCM's export
  profits.
      ""Most specialists I have talked to tell me the break-even
  point for ZCCM is a rate of 10 kwacha per dollar,"" Frederick
  Chiluba, leader of the Zambian Congress of Trade Unions said.
      High production costs continue to bedevil the Zambian
  industry.
      Zambia mines copper at a relatively expensive rate of 69
  cents per pound, compared with 55 cents in the United States
  and under 40 cents in Chile.
      The industry also faces transport problems due to Zambia
  being landlocked. The government confirmed this year it had
  stopped sBending copper south through South Africa.
      Over 80 pct of shipments, some 35,000 tonnes a month, are
  sent by rail to the Tanzanian port of Dar-es-Salaam, while
  5,000 tonnes go via Zimbabwe to the Mozambique port of Beira.
  Transport has often been hit by shortages of wagons, spares and
  fuel.

      ""The cost of this approach is that the much-needed revival

"['cpi', 'gnp']","ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - KUWAITI ECONOMY
  Kuwait's oil-reliant and debt-ridden
  economy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil prices
  will determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economists
  say.
      Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to hold
  oil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the
  northern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens.
      Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of gross
  domestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last year
  after contracting 8.1 pct the year before.
      This was after taking into account inflation in consumer
  prices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.
      Factors depressing economic activity include the
  6-1/2-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait's doorstep, which
  threatens the emirate's vital oil export lifeline through the
  Gulf and has sapped business confidence.
      But sentiment received a much-needed boost in September
  when, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis
  caused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensive
  new debt settlement program was introduced.
      The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forward
  trading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default.
      The cheques were also used as collateral for consumer
  spending, thus generating an informal credit system.
      Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are
  still owed by individuals and companies.
      There was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs)
  in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of which
  one-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank as
  bad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said it
  will not allow any banks to go under.
      The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of
  problem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether
  debtors have regular cash flows or not.
      Banks' shareholders and depositors will have their rights
  guaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance
  in a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector
  is the biggest after oil.
      Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride
  out the oil glut, bankers and economists say.
      Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd)
  compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last
  year by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah.
      But strategic diversification into downstream operations in
  Europe several years ago and a hefty refining investment at
  home gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell
  over one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.
      Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average
  2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed
  product such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as
  crude.
      Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason
  for cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domestic
  inflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent
  years and signs government spending on productive sectors will
  remain steady.
      External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8
  billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct below
  that for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hit
  Gulf.
      Kuwait's petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put
  officially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment income
  of the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.
      But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, these
  reserves may not be enough to prevent a ""real"" budget deficit for
  the 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say.
      In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary,
  revenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct,
  doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.
      This left out income from state reserves, usually excluded
  in official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers at
  up to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in some
  shortfall.
      Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for
  economic growth this year or next.
      ""It depends on oil prices,"" one said. ""This summer is
  important.""
      Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sunday
  the cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state
  spending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the
  economy.
      He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be
  spelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in June.

['trade'],"JAPAN CONCERNED AT EC TRADE THREATS - MINISTER
  Japan is disappointed at the recent threats
  of trade retaliation from the European Community (EC) just as
  the trade situation between the two is improving, Japanese
  Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura said.
      ""I am deeply concerned that the EC has moved to take a
  harsher line toward Japan despite this tangible improvement,"" he
  said in a speech prepared for delivery at the opening of a new
  centre designed to improve understanding between the two sides.
      Last week, foreign ministers of the 12 EC nations agreed to
  impose tariffs on a range of unspecified Japanese electrical
  goods unless Tokyo opened its markets more to EC exports.
      Tamura referred to a 55 pct rise in Japanese imports of EC
  manufactured goods in the year ended March 31.
      ""I feel this is a strong step on the road to balance through
  expansion.""
      ""While I do not deny the existence of the trade deficit
  between Japan and the EC, I believe it should be rectified not
  by reducing trade through import restrictions or export
  restraints, but by expanding the (overall) trade,"" Tamura said.
  

"
['trade'],"ASIAN EXPORTERS FEAR DAMAGE FROM U.S.-JAPAN RIFT
  Mounting trade friction between the
  U.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia's exporting
  nations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic
  damage, businessmen and officials said.
      They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S.
  Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the
  U.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products.
      But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt
  them in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo's loss might be
  their gain.
      The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on
  imports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, in
  retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact not
  to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost.
      Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs
  at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms
  said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the
  new taxes.
      ""We wouldn't be able to do business,"" said a spokesman for
  leading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric
  Industrial Co Ltd &lt;MC.T>.
      ""If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time
  beyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of
  exports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.,"" said Tom
  Murtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker &lt;James
  Capel and Co>.
      In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried.
      ""We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat against
  Japan because it serves as a warning to us,"" said a senior
  Taiwanese trade official who asked not to be named.
      Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last
  year, 95 pct of it with the U.S.
      The surplus helped swell Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves
  to 53 billion dlrs, among the world's largest.
      ""We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and
  cut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if we
  want to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation,"" said
  Paul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters &lt;Taiwan Safe Group>.
      A senior official of South Korea's trade promotion
  association said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japan
  might also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exports
  are similar to those of Japan.
      Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion
  dlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.
      In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough
  curbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers of
  semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the
  U.S.
      In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has been
  selling below-cost semiconductors, some electronics
  manufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said such
  a short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by
  further U.S. Pressure to block imports.
      ""That is a very short-term view,"" said Lawrence Mills,
  director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.
      ""If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will
  be extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kong
  is the disadvantage of action restraining trade,"" he said.
      The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong's biggest export market,
  accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.
      The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade
  talks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern,
  Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday.
      ""This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two
  countries which are major trading partners of ours is a very
  serious matter,"" Button said.
      He said Australia's concerns centred on coal and beef,
  Australia's two largest exports to Japan and also significant
  U.S. Exports to that country.
      Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the
  trade stand-off continue.
      Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined
  a package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy.
      The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget
  and record public works spending in the first half of the
  financial year.
      They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency
  measure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister
  Yasuhiro Nakasone's avowed fiscal reform program.
      Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and Makoto
  Kuroda, Japan's deputy minister of International Trade and
  Industry (MITI), are due to meet in Washington this week in an
  effort to end the dispute.

  Phelps Dodge Corp officials said good
  fundamentals in copper markets should lead to improving prices
  for the metal.
      In an interview with Reuters, chairman G. Robert Durham
  said continued strong demand and low inventories pushed prices
  up eight to nine pct on the New York Commodities Exchange last
  month.
      ""Our customers in this country are living off the tailgates
  of our trucks,"" he said, referring to tightness of supply and
  strong demand. ""The fundamentals are good.""
     
      Asked if metal prices will continue to rise, Durham said;
  ""All I know is, fundamentals cannot be ignored.""
      He said copper supplies are lower than they have been for
  almost 20 years. Last year, copper demand was second highest on
  record behind 1984, he said.
      Phelps Dodge is the nation's largest copper company, with
  annual production expected to reach 500,000 tons this year.
     
      During the interview, executive vice president Douglas
  Yearley said he believed it was only a matter of time before
  the copper price rose ""because there aren't that many new
  projects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession,
  will continue to grow modestly.""
      Copper for July delivery rose more than two cts a pound to
  more than 69 cents in Comex trading today. A one cent a pound
  rise in copper prices yields 10 mln dlrs in annual earnings for
  Phelps Dodge, the company said.
      ""Demand has been surprisingly good in 1987, in construction
  and other areas,"" Yearley said.
     
      New production later this year from a Bingham, Utah, mine
  owned by Kennecott Corp, a unit of British Petroleum Co PLC's
  &lt;BP> Standard Oil Co, a mine in New Guinea and Phelps Dodge's
  own expanded Morenci, Ariz., mine will be offset by production
  shortfalls in Mexico and Zambia, he said.
      Durham said production costs at the New Mexico-located
  Chino mine will be in line with conventional copper production
  at the company's other mines by the fourth quarter. The
  company's total production costs, including depreciation but
  before interest and corporate expense, should be below 50 cts a

"['alum', 'copper', 'gold', 'silver']","LITTLE REACTION TO REMOVAL COMEX DAILY LIMITS
  The elimination of limits on daily price
  fluctuations for metals futures contracts traded on the
  Commodity Exchange, COMEX, appears to be having little effect
  on the market, analysts said.
      ""There is nothing apparent from the change,"" said William
  O'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc.
      ""The market has not approached the old price limits and
  trading is relative quiet, in narrow ranges,"" he said.
      On May 5, COMEX eliminated price limits on the two
  contracts following each spot delivery in gold, silver, copper
  and aluminum futures after a review of its clearing operations,
  which were severely tested by a volatile market in silver
  futures at the end of April. COMEX announced Friday the lifting
  of all daily limits, effective today.
      Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs per
  ounce in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker in the
  nearby contracts amid thin volume conditions, traders said.
      Silver futures, previously limited at 50 cents in most back
  months, were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the nearby
  contracts amid quiet trading today.
      During the last week of April, silver futures often traded
  at the daily allowable limit amid concerns about inflation, the
  dollar, and other factors. Traders rushed into the spot, or
  unlimited, contract to offset those moves, analysts said.
      As a result, O'Neill said, there was much confusion, many
  unmatched trades, and large losses for some traders.
      The COMEX fined four large firms a total of 100,000 dlrs
  for failure to resolve unmatched trades in a timely manner.
      Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers,
  said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panic
  buying or selling and contribute to more orderly markets.
      O'Neill added that the elimination of daily limits would
  add caution to trading.
      ""This is a more realistic approach because the metals
  market is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,""
  O'Neill said.
  

"
['yen'],"YEN SEEN RISING AFTER G-7 COMMUNIQUE
  The yen is likely to start another
  uneven rise against the dollar and other major currencies
  because the Group of Seven communique contained nothing new,
  currency and bond analysts here said.
      ""Is that it? I was expecting something more than that,"" said
  one trader at a major Wall Street securities company.
      Marc Cohen of Republic National Bank of New York said: ""The
  market now has the impetus to drive the dollar lower again.""
      The dollar hovered between 145.50 and 147 yen in the days
  just before the talks. Dealers restrained their underlying
  bearishness and squared positions ahead of Wednesday's meeting
  of the finance ministers and central bankers of the top seven
  industrialized nations in Washington.
      After more than four hours of talks, the G-7 issued a
  communique which merely reaffirmed the recent Paris agreement's
  view that prevailing currency levels were broadly consistent
  with economic fundamentals and that exchange rate stability
  should be fostered around these levels.
      The dollar sank to 144.75 yen in early Tokyo trading.
      ""They said that the dollar/yen rate was broadly in line with
  fundamentals when it was 154. Now they are saying it's in line
  when it's at 146. Will this still be so at 138 or 130?,"" asked
  Republic's Cohen.
      Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa fuelled
  speculation about the amount of fluctuation the authorities are
  prepared to tolerate by saying that the current yen level is
  still inside the range agreed on in Paris in late February.
      Official statements in recent weeks had indicated that the
  key psychological level of 150 yen was at the lower end of the
  authorities' permissible range.
      Dealers and analysts warned that the dollar's decline would
  probably be uneven. They anticipated a concerted effort to prop
  up the dollar and restrain the yen via a mixture of open market
  intervention and public comments.
      Shortly after the Tokyo market opened today the Bank of
  Japan was detected by local dealers buying moderate amounts of
  dollars. The dollar rebounded to about 145.20 yen.
      The sources said the market may also be wary of agressively
  selling dollars for yen before Tuesday's February U.S. Trade
  data. The figures are expected to show a deficit of 13 billion
  dlrs, from a provisional 14.8 billion in January.

"['interest', 'money-fx']","TREASURY'S BAKER UNDER FIRE FOR WALL STREET DROP
  As official Washington sought to
  restore investor confidence after Monday's Wall Street
  collapse, Treasury Secretary James Baker came under fire from
  critics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis.
      Baker's weekend blast at the West German Bundesbank for
  boosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of an
  international accord to stabilize currency values.
      Nigel Lawson, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, was
  among those who said the treasury secretary's statements helped
  spur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investors
  think that a clash between the two major economic powers would
  damage the world economy.
      Lawson told a London television interviewer Tuesday, ""I
  think the scale of the (stock) fall was very great. That, I
  think, was partly due to statements that have been made by
  senior figures on the other side of the Atlantic."" It was a
  dispute that should never have happened, he added.
      Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at a
  hastily-called meeting with West German officials Monday, he  
  still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the United
  States on Tuesday. Baker cut short a long-planned trip to
  Scandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis.
      Said one U.S. analyst of Baker's weekend remarks, ""His
  timing could not have been worse.""
      One government bond salesman in New York said, ""He actually
  thought that yelling at the Germans, and threatening to smack
  the dollar down would work. That doesn't show much
  understanding of international monetary gamesmanship.""
      However, some analysts said West Germany's stubborn march
  toward higher interest rates may have forced Baker's hand.
      ""On the surface Baker may look responsible for this, but if
  you go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financial
  markets), it was West German policy,"" said Robert Brusca of
  Nikko Securities International in New York.
      ""All Mr. Baker did was to mention the obvious in public, so
  making him responsible for it was a little like killing the
  messenger,"" he said.
      After Monday's talks, the U.S. and West German governments
  made it clear that the Louvre currency accord, pieced together
  in Paris in February, was still in effect.
      Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might be
  a prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar to
  the late 1970s. Analysts believe Monday's Wall Street crash
  wiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values.
     Treasury sources said that Baker, already unhappy about
  Bonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the
  global recovery moving, was angered by a Bundesbank interest
  rate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite.
      He felt that the U.S. recovery, inching along in its 59th
  month, could no longer be the only engine of global economic
  expansion. A growing U.S. economy has been serving as a huge
  market for debtor country exports.
      Moreover, Baker, the consummate politician, was worried
  that the Republican party might face next year's presidential
  election with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badly
  tarnished.
      A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt
  crisis and completely choke off U.S. economic growth that has
  already slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate.
      ""There's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the
  economy, and it's important that the psychology turn around
  quickly, or else obviously the panic will feed on itself, and
  eventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically,""
  former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in a
  television interview.
      In many ways, the official response was mild.
      Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat,
  with President Reagan speaking for most people by admitting
  that he was ""puzzled.""
      U.S. government sources said the secretary immediately
  returned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developments
  and, presumably, their political impact.
      For all of this, it seems unlikely that Baker's status in
  Washington will diminish because of the market fall.
      Asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll because
  of the Wall Street retreat, Texas Democratic Senator Lloyd
  Bentsen said with some irony, ""Oh, I think it's much too late to
  be doing that...You have an administration that's taken the
  attitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and ---
  retire to the living room to take a nap. You just can't do
  that.""

['acq'],"INVESTORS MAY TAKE COMPUTERLAND PUBLIC
  The investor group that has agreed to
  buy &lt;Computerland Corp> will likely take the leading personal
  computer retailer public or sell it to other investors,
  industry analysts said.
      ""Now's a good time,"" said Joe Levy of International Data
  Corp. ""The personal computer industry has bottomed out and is
  on the way up again,"" he said.
      Earlier today, closely held Computerland, the largest PC
  retailing chain in the country, said it agreed to be bought by
  an investor group led by E.M. Warburg Pincus and Co, New York.
      Neither Computerland, which is 96 pct owned by its founder,
  William H. Millard, nor E.M. Warburg, a money management and
  venture capital firm, would disclose the value of the
  transaction.
      Analysts estimated that Computerland, whose 800 stores
  generated 1.4 billion dlrs in sales last year, would fetch  150
  mln dlrs to 250 mln dlrs. Computerland franchise owners pay
  royalties averaging 5.9 pct to the parent company.
      Officials for E.M. Warburg referred all questions to
  Computerland. Computerland officials could not immediately be
  reached for comment.
      E.M. Warburg currently manages 1.5 billion dlrs in venture
  capital funds, and its past investments have included Mattel
  Inc &lt;MAT> and the Ingersoll newspaper chain. It is also a money
  manager, with 3.5 billion dlrs under management.
     Although the PC retailers are benefitting from the strong
  upturn in PC sales, analysts said Computerland must make key
  changes if it is to fend off advances from rivals like
  Businessland Inc &lt;BUSL.O> and Tandy Corp's &lt;TAN> Radio Shack
  stores. ""The name of the game now is outbound sales forces,
  customer service and customer support,"" said Levy of
  International Data.
  
      Relations between Computerland and its franchise owners
  have mellowed recently after Millard was forced to give up
  managment control of the company in 1985.
      Ed Faber, who took over as chairman and chief executive
  officer, revamped the company's royalty plan, which help quell
  much of the franchisee dissent.

      Under a 1985 agreement with the now-defunct U.S. Synthetic

  Finance ministers from seven major
  industrialized nations agreed on the need to stabilize
  currencies at current levels but said more action was needed to
  reduce trade imbalances and sustain economic growth.
      In a communique issued after a four-hour meeting at the
  U.S. Treasury that ended last night, the ministers said the
  value of the dollar and other currencies was basically correct
  now, and they welcomed new measures planned by the Japanese to
  boost their economy.
      West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg called it
  a ""good meeting"" and in brief remarks exchanged with reporters
  other ministers seemed pleased with its outcome.
      Shortly after the communique was issued and just as foreign
  exchange trading opened in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan intervened
  again to prevent the yen rising too quickly.
      The communique said, ""The ministers and governors reaffirmed
  the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent
  Paris meeting. They agreed, however, that further actions will
  be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain
  global economic expansion and reduce trade imbalances.""
      It welcomed the plans set this week by the Japan's ruling
  Liberal Democratic Party to stimulate its economy with what the
  communique termed ""extraordinary and urgent measures"" including
  an ""unprecedented front-end loading of public works
  expenditures.""
      The meeting of the so-called Group of Seven brought
  together ministers and central bank governors of the seven
  major industrial democracies, the United States, Japan, West

      The communique said the ministers reaffirmed the commitment

  The United States may lift an
  additional 84 mln dlrs in trade sanctions against Japan later
  this month, Reagan Administration officials said.
      President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions on
  Japanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986
  agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the U.S. and third
  country markets and to open its home market to U.S. goods.
      The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct on
  Japanese color television sets, hand-held power tools and
  portable computers.
      Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June  after
  Japan ended selling the semiconductors on the U.S. market at
  below production costs.
      Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memory
  and recall purposes in a wide variety of computers.
      The Administration officials said Commerce Department 
  monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of the
  semiconductors in third countries, where they had been taking
  sales away from American-made semiconductors.
      They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions would
  be lifted by the end of the month.
      The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening the
  closed Japanese markets to U.S. goods.
      U.S. and Japanese officials reviewed Japan's compliance
  with the agreement earlier this week.
      The periodic reviews are to continue and the remaining
  sanctions to stay in force, the officials said, until Japan is
  in full compliance with the semiconductor agreement.

      But netbacks for crude oil refined in Singapore fell

  Australia's economy should manage modest

      The organisation's latest half-yearly report says Gross
  Domestic Product will grow by 2.5 pct this year and by 2.75 pct
  in 1988 compared with only 1.4 pct in 1986. The growth will be
  helped by higher stockbuilding and stronger domestic demand
  following tax cuts and higher real wages, it added.
      The report forecasts a decline in inflation, with consumer
  prices increasing by 8.5 pct this year and 6.25 pct in 1988.
      The current account deficit shows signs of easing slightly
  and could narrow to 12 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.
      While predicting slightly stronger growth than last year,
  however, the report revises downwards the OECD's earlier growth
  forecast for 1987 of 3.75 pct.
      The OECD predicts a similar combination of modest economic
  growth and rising unemployment for New Zealand, which is
  struggling to recover from a major economic crisis.

  the 1.5 billion dlrs Britain had hoped to secure.
      The committee said U.S. Technology export restrictions and
  ""selectiveness"" towards foreign contractors had denied British
  competitors more lucrative orders and largely excluded them
  from technological research for SDI.
      Younger said London had given U.S. Companies contracts
  under conditions of fair and open competition. ""All we ask is
  for our companies to be given similar opportunities,"" he added.
      If new American legislation aimed at curbing unfair
